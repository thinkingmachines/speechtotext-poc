 Good afternoon everyone.,56.394,57.69

 Okay.,83.274,84.666
 Let me put up,85.77,87.93
" The slight, hopefully, the slight shock comes up properly.",96.81,100.122
 Okay.,100.746,102.33
 I guess what happened in,104.202,106.074
 was that we,108.81,110.394
 began to roll out our business plan.,110.442,113.178
 We launched one,113.61,116.538
" out of total nine projects, nine new projects",117.738,121.722
 planning for the year.,121.962,123.45
" The respondent was Quai, well received.",123.594,125.658
 The result? The performance,127.05,129.226
 car seems to be picking up,129.226,131.13
 The momentum.,131.274,132.762
 especially when you compare it,133.194,135.642
 Prior,135.69,137.082
 which is reflected in financial statements.,139.338,142.266
 uh... d out look uh...,142.506,145.146
 our business plan for the year.,148.842,150.81
 we still have eight more new projects,151.146,155.13
 with the firm's backlogs in our pockets.,156.426,160.026
" Other than that, I'll just go into the detail.",162.378,164.634
 This is a recap of what,165.642,168.35399999999998
 we have communicated,168.35399999999998,171.06599999999997
" widely, publicly.",172.458,174.522
 This year will be,176.298,177.69
 a year we would read,177.93,179.418
 benefit from our asset base.,179.562,182.49
" Two or three years of hibernation, I would say.",185.226,188.442
 We did a couple of things,188.49,191.13
" Fundamentally, we",191.466,193.952
 did a big restructuring in,193.952,196.794
 2021,197.034,198.522
 in terms of balance sheet management.,198.858,201.498
 Also in terms of a shareholding structure as well.,202.89,206.298
" And during 2022,",206.826,209.754
 which we were still,209.994,211.77
 Slow down by,212.298,213.978
 pandemic.,214.314,215.898
 We did a couple of reforms.,216.33,220.122
 Acquire a few pieces of,222.378,224.68499999999997
" new land, raw material.",224.68499999999997,227.32199999999997
" as well as, the product development.",228.522,231.066
 I think if you follow us,231.69,233.778
 closely you might have seen,233.778,235.86599999999999
 some brand new product which we will be prepared,236.202,239.898
 in this presentation as well.,240.138,242.298
 ripping the value forward,244.65,246.906
 means nine projects earmarked for,247.05,250.746
" 21, about 21 billion baht in project",250.89,253.66199999999998
" value, combined project value.",253.66199999999998,255.92999999999998
 some new products coming in,257.514,260.922
" particularly, the very top end, the Wena collection.",261.45,265.05
" Anubhāna, absolute.",265.386,266.778
 and a return of Navana,267.306,269.633
" at work, Home Office product.",269.633,272.25
 which we haven't,272.298,273.594
 launched new project for a while already.,273.642,276.57
 There would be a lounge of 2 high rise condominiums,277.866,281.376
 as well. I will go into detail.,281.376,284.346
 maybe toward the end,284.586,286.266
 Presentation.,287.082,288.378
 And,288.618,289.914
 lastly nirvana porsche,290.058,292.122
 That would be a retail,293.802,296.442
 commercial retail space.,296.778,299.61
" To, basically, poof.",299.754,301.722
 The Township development that we have planned for,303.018,306.618
" Okay, a recap of 9 projects, 21 billion baht.",313.674,317.466
 We want,317.802,319.098
 Planed launch 3 single,319.914,321.899
 detached house projects,321.899,324.282
" nāvāna collection, nāvāna absolute, nāvāna",324.618,327.93
" Asshu in True Location, Koontheprita",327.978,330.858
 and Eka Mayramintra,330.858,332.538
 One Townhouse Project,332.874,334.81600000000003
", known as DeFi.",334.81600000000003,337.146
 It's a new and improved product.,337.194,340.506
 That respond more to the change in behavior,340.842,344.058
 post-the pandemic.,344.394,346.074
 condominium as I mentioned,347.658,350.164
", to high rise one in",350.164,351.834
 Ratanathibet area and one in the center of,352.074,355.29
 Bangkok,355.53,356.922
" Home office, there would be about 2",360.138,363.618
 or 3 projects coming up this year.,363.618,367.098
" In the first Quarter, we launched",367.626,370.554
 nirvana absolute,372.234,373.914
 The second location,375.306,377.082
 of of this series,377.13,379.002
" If you remember, I think",379.338,381.394
" in the second half of last year,",381.394,383.706
 We launched Navana absolute in Bangna,383.946,386.394
 But this one is in the temple of Ravintra.,386.826,389.85
 Not a very big project.,395.85,397.818
 The product itself,399.402,400.89
 area very very well.,402.282,404.826
 The response was quite,405.354,408.09
 Encouraging.,409.098,410.49
" Although the number doesn't seem so big,",411.21,413.466
" The case of sales, we're about",414.762,417.498
 Over 40% so,417.546,419.13
 in in the,420.138,421.434
 in the first Quarter.,421.674,423.354
" during launch, the first weekend actually at launch.",423.402,427.29
 it's a brand new,429.546,431.898
 Single house is dead.,433.386,434.778
 That if you if you if you notice that the,434.922,437.754
 The second story has an outdoor area,438.09,440.634
 with green,440.874,442.458
 and double volume all the way up to the third floor,444.042,447.354
 concrete blocks,451.05,453.21
 That give you some sort of privacy,453.546,456.498
 rather than normal veranda or,456.498,459.45
 balcony.,459.69,461.178
" So, it is what we put out into market. This is the",461.706,465.474
 other view of it looking out from the inside of the house.,465.474,469.24199999999996
 you can see you can actually use,469.386,471.738
 with the privacy that you might need.,474.282,477.882
" and indoor, there would be some",479.178,482.394
 I guess if you're Japanese-based,484.362,487.16900000000004
", this would be a dining table.",487.16900000000004,489.21000000000004
" But for for us here,",489.642,492.186
" in Thailand, it could be used",492.426,495.36899999999997
 as a living area.,495.36899999999997,497.65799999999996
 be used for working from home area.,497.994,501.498
 you can imagine when you do a conference call online,501.642,505.53
 There would be no one walking in a bag,505.77,508.627
. So you get a professional look.,508.627,511.77
 through your online teleconferencing.,512.01,514.746
" This is,",516.906,518.586
 He picked some pictures of of the launch date,518.634,522.042
" So it was quite well-received, as I",522.474,525.4000000000001
" mentioned, almost 50% in one weekend.",525.4000000000001,528.57
" Operationally, as I mentioned, we launched",532.074,535.458
" only one, which started off with during the first quarter.",535.458,538.842
 uh,539.082,540.666
" Three projects coming up, this quarter.",540.906,543.258
 And so we total,543.69,546.234
" So, a total active projects about",549.162,551.706
 The pretails from,553.77,556.41
 of and yeah during the first order,557.514,560.154
 Revenue,562.218,563.61
 was not that strong but comparing,563.754,566.974
 to the prior order,566.974,568.986
" It's a good sign, good recovery.",569.13,571.194
 after sobering from from the pandemic effect.,571.338,574.458
 Those 12 active projects,579.498,581.658
 as I mentioned.,581.898,583.194
 The total,584.49,586.074
 Backlog,586.506,587.898
 of combining with,588.042,590.106
 with a carrying forward backlog from end of year.,590.442,594.426
 plus the new pre-sale.,594.57,596.154
 Minus the transfer.,596.298,598.362
 We net at about almost 1.3.,598.506,601.626
 in terms of backlogs,603.786,605.658
 The 12 projects combined,605.994,608.826
 Estimate around,609.93,611.226
 12.5 billion baht in,611.466,613.722
 available for sales.,613.962,615.834
 out of 1 billion baht,619.242,622.074
 Pre-sale you can see,622.314,625.146
 The pre-sale paste is roughly,625.386,627.882
 around the same as the,627.882,629.7539999999999
" as a small remark,",632.394,635.706
 had not launched new projects,636.138,639.6270000000001
 for almost nine years.,639.6270000000001,642.618
" During the pandemic, we we lay low",644.01,646.938
 We adjust more fundamentals,647.274,651.076
 and so,651.076,652.0260000000001
 Survive and stay afloat,652.746,654.618
 We were forced,655.818,657.21
 who sells whatever left in a portfolio.,657.642,660.378
" And, basically, all projects running in the background",661.578,665.562
 But we started to launch new,666.282,669.378
 projects in both Quarter 2022,669.378,672.474
 That's how we achieve 1 billion baht.,672.618,676.026
 pre-sale order.,677.226,679.098
" which is good sign, that means",680.394,682.65
 still there. When we come back to the market,684.042,686.957
", the response was quite well-received.",686.957,690.138
" And, um...",691.53,693.21
 Continue launching new,694.794,696.692
 projects in the past.,696.692,698.97
 in the next three-quarters of this year.,699.21,702.33
 we expect to to the case to pick up,703.05,706.554
" In terms of revenue,",709.866,712.314
 I mean if you look if you look on an overall basis you can see,712.458,716.058
 it drops quite significant.,716.106,718.266
 But if you look more into,718.698,721.1899999999999
" detail, which is",721.1899999999999,722.9699999999999
" The great area, the lighter shade and the darker shade.",723.21,727.194
 You can see especially in,729.066,731.393
" the dark, the cells of real estate",731.393,734.01
 meaning you know all those residential,734.154,736.506
 UNIX that we transferred,737.61,739.578
 in the past,739.722,741.018
 order and order,741.162,742.65
 in a prior year.,742.794,744.474
 You can see that the momentum,744.714,747.2650000000001
 is has been picking up,747.2650000000001,749.1780000000001
 A small remark in,752.202,754.231
 the first quarter 2022.,754.231,756.6659999999999
 There was about 634 million baht in terms of,756.906,760.039
" revenue. That was part of our, I would",760.039,763.172
" say, last activities in terms of balance",763.172,766.59
 sheet reforms we have been talking about.,766.59,769.7230000000001
 We,770.154,771.45
 We sell some piece of land bank,771.498,773.97
", high potential land bank",773.97,776.442
" To diversify into area, into other area",776.874,780.378
 as well as,780.426,781.818
 and are trading into,781.962,783.354
 new market which,783.498,785.586
 we were not able,785.586,787.674
" So, that's something that we have talked",788.298,791.028
 over for many times already.,791.028,793.338
" So,",793.482,794.778
 I might not cover in detail.,795.114,797.37
 Financial results,800.586,802.65
 It's,803.178,804.954
 I kind of summarized it already,805.194,809.2919999999999
 but maybe I'll pick a few points here.,809.2919999999999,813.0179999999999
" The top line we talked about, uh",813.354,816.1650000000001
", the revenue from construction contract.",816.1650000000001,819.258
 I guess I'll expand on it a little bit.,819.402,822.33
 This line is,822.954,825.882
 coming from construction,826.698,828.666
 Home construction.,829.098,830.682
 construction service.,831.018,832.506
 Because the the,832.842,834.138
 Part of our projects are being ordered.,836.778,839.514
 So customer buy houses into,840.042,842.97
 land purchase as well as,845.034,847.866
 construction contract.,850.314,852.09
" So, this line is the Revenue that comes in from",853.77,857.754
 construction of those bill-to-order units.,857.994,861.402
 They come in installments.,861.546,865.338
" In the past, this line was also",865.578,868.506
 Revenue coming from,869.802,871.578
" our OEM service, which we provide",871.722,873.933
 to other developers.,873.933,875.898
 We went up and built,876.234,878.97
 houses for,879.306,881.274
 precast capabilities,882.57,884.538
 That we acquire it through the thigh through,884.874,886.938
 We use that.,888.426,889.722
 capacity to,889.866,891.954
 help prop up revenue,891.954,894.0419999999999
 on the construction service as well.,894.282,896.346
 But the thing that has changed for this year is that the,897.066,900.666
 with 9 new projects we are launching,900.714,903.374
", we need all of those capacities",903.374,906.33
" To do it with ourself, internally.",906.666,908.826
" So,that's why we",909.066,910.458
 If you compare,910.602,912.954
" First Quarter, last year you could see",913.098,915.354
 All revenue from this line is from our own due to order,919.242,923.154
 units or what we call turnkey solution projects.,923.154,927.066
 Built-to-order houses.,928.266,930.522
 The gross margin comes back to,931.914,934.1949999999999
 the more or less normal level.,934.1949999999999,936.762
 34% mid 30s,936.81,938.682
 as opposed to the first order last,940.266,942.786
 year was normally high because of that,942.786,945.3059999999999
 land transaction as I mentioned,946.218,949.05
" Distribution cost,",950.634,953.37
 in line with,953.418,955.194
 But maybe slightly more because we're,956.778,959.773
 doing some more marketing activities,959.773,963.517
 for new projects we're launching.,963.517,966.138
" Other than that, maybe, maybe, um,",969.066,971.994
 Financial cost.,972.714,974.874
 it's a bit much much lower,975.018,978.042
 and prior year.,978.666,979.962
 That's a counting effect when,980.202,982.626
 you start developing the land.,982.626,985.05
 All those,985.194,986.49
 interest payment,986.634,988.218
 post max to uh,989.994,991.962
 being recognized as,992.586,994.458
 or is it more of an interest capitalization as,994.698,998.461
 opposed to being recognized as interest-expense. That,998.461,1002.4590000000001
's the only difference. We pay the same interest.,1002.4590000000001,1006.4570000000001
 different accounting treatments.,1008.042,1009.818
" In terms of Asset, I guess Asset",1011.402,1015.0740000000001
 base hasn't changed much from last year.,1015.0740000000001,1018.7460000000001
 up in the last year.,1018.89,1020.474
 Maybe only one line has changed,1020.714,1023.0450000000001
 was the short-term loan.,1023.0450000000001,1024.794
 others.,1024.842,1026.138
 That's a result,1026.186,1028.6209999999999
 of our strategic,1028.6209999999999,1030.6499999999999
 Decided to apply,1032.33,1034.302
 the remaining 30% of,1034.302,1036.6019999999999
