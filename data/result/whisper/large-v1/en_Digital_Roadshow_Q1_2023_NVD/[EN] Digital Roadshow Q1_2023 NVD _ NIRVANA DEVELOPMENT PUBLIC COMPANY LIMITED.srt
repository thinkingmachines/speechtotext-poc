00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,840
Hello, good afternoon, investors and corporates. Welcome to ZDigital Roadshow first quarter

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:22,400
2023 performance review. This section will run about 45 minutes including Q&A. Company

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,680
will start the section by 30-minute presentation followed by 15-minute Q&A. And during Q&A,

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,200
investors may leave your question in the meeting room chat box or use the raise your hand function.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
We will open your microphone so you can ask the questions to the company directly.

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,240
So may I now invite Nirvana Development, Patrick Company Limited, to start the presentation,

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,280
please. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction.

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,160
Good afternoon, everyone. I want to ask back to report, actually maybe to update. I guess

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,280
we talked about the first quarter results about maybe a month or two ago. This is our regular

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:23,440
digital roadshow that we provide updates for those who may not be in Bangkok. Okay.

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,600
Let me put up the slides.

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:47,200
Okay. Hopefully the slideshow comes up properly. Okay. I guess what happened in the first quarter

13
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:59,520
was that we began to roll out our business plan. We opened, we launched one project out of total

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,440
nine new projects that we planned for the year. The response was quite well received.

15
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:15,200
The result, the performance seems to be picking up the momentum especially when you compare to the

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:27,440
prior quarter, which reflected in the financial statements. The outlook, we're still moving on

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,560
our business plan for the year. We still have eight more new projects to launch

18
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:44,320
with the firm backlogs in our pockets. Other than that, I'll just go into the detail.

19
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:56,800
This is basically a recap of what we have communicated widely, publicly that this year

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:06,560
will be a year that we would reap benefit from our asset base. After two or three years of

21
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:16,320
hibernation, I would say, we did a couple of things fundamentally. We did a big restructuring in

22
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:26,000
2021 in terms of balance sheet management, also in terms of shareholding structure as well.

23
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:38,800
And during 2022, which we were still slowed down by the pandemic, we did a couple of reforms,

24
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:50,880
acquired a few pieces of new land, raw material, as well as the product development.

25
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,560
I think if you follow us closely, you might have seen some brand new product, which we

26
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:07,040
will prepare to show in this presentation as well. So for reaping the value forward,

27
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,400
means nine projects earmarked for this year, about 21 billion baht in project values,

28
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:23,600
combined project values. Some new products coming in, particularly the very top end,

29
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,320
Novana Collection and Novana Absolute, and a return of Novana at Work home office product,

30
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:41,040
which we haven't launched new project for a while already. There would be a launch of two

31
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,760
high-rise condominiums as well. I will go into detail maybe toward the end of the presentation.

32
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:59,120
And lastly, Novana Porsche Lifestyle Mall. That would be a retail, commercial retail space

33
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:07,600
to basically fulfill the township development that we have planned for Phuket Greta.

34
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay, a recap of nine projects, 21 billion baht. We plan to launch three single detached house

35
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,960
projects. Novana Collection, Novana Absolute, Novana Absolute in two locations, Phuket Greta

36
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:40,800
and Ekamai Ramintra. One townhouse project, Novana Define, is a new and improved product

37
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:49,200
that responds more to the change in behavior post the pandemic. Condominium, as I mentioned,

38
00:05:49,200 --> 00:06:00,960
two high-rise, one in Ratanathibet area and one in the center of Bangkok CBD. And home office,

39
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:10,160
there would be about two or three projects coming up this year. In the first quarter, we launched

40
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:21,120
our Novana Absolute in the second location of this series. If you remember, I think in the

41
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,680
second half of last year, we launched Novana Absolute in Bangna. But this one is in Ekamai Ramintra.

42
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:44,640
It's not a very big project, but the product itself fits in this area very, very well.

43
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,520
The response was quite encouraging. Although the number doesn't seem so big,

44
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:04,240
but the pace of sales, basically we're about over 40% in the first quarter during the launch,

45
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:16,960
the first weekend actually at the launch. So it's a brand new series of single houses. If you notice

46
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:26,080
that the second story has an outdoor area with green trees and double volume all the way up to

47
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:37,520
the third floor with some concrete blocks that give you some sort of privacy rather than normal

48
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:45,760
veranda or a balcony. So this is what we put out into the market. This is the way,

49
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,880
the other view of it, looking out from the inside of the house, you can see that you can actually

50
00:07:50,880 --> 00:08:01,280
use the outdoor space with the privacy that you might need. And indoor, there would be some,

51
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:13,760
I guess, if you have Japanese space, this would be a dining table. But for us here in Thailand,

52
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,960
it could be used as a living area, be used for working from home area. You can imagine that

53
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,240
when you do a conference call online, there would be no one walking in the back.

54
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,560
So you get that professional look through your online teleconferencing.

55
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:42,240
This is basically the, we picked some pictures of the launch date. So it was quite well received,

56
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,320
as I mentioned, about almost 50%. So, you know, in one weekend.

57
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,800
Operationally, as I mentioned, we launched only one to start off with during the first quarter,

58
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:05,840
during the first quarter, three projects coming up this quarter. And so we total

59
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:17,680
project, total active projects about 12 projects. The pre-sales from the beginning of,

60
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,200
yeah, during the first quarter is about a billion baht. Revenue was not that strong,

61
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,200
but comparing to the prior quarter is a good sign, good recovery after sobering from the

62
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:47,680
pandemic effect. To recap of those 12 active projects, as I mentioned, the total backlog

63
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,760
combining with the carrying forward backlog from the end of the year, plus the new pre-sales,

64
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:07,840
minus the transfer, we net at about almost 1.3 billion baht in terms of backlogs. The 12 projects

65
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:15,440
combined estimate around 12.5 billion baht available for sales.

66
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:28,960
Out of the 1 billion baht pre-sales, you can see that the pre-sale pace is roughly around the same

67
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:39,600
as the fourth quarter. As a small remark that we had not opened, had not launched new projects

68
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:49,360
for the past, I would say, almost nine quarters. During the pandemic, we lay low. We adjust more

69
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,720
fundamentals so that we could survive and stay afloat. So we were forced to

70
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,560
sales whatever left in the portfolio. And basically those old projects that are running

71
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:12,560
in the background. But we started to launch new projects in the fourth quarter of 2022.

72
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,800
That's how we achieved the 1 billion baht roughly pre-sales quarter,

73
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,120
which is a good sign. That means customer base is still there. When we come back to the market,

74
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:38,560
the response was quite well received. And as we continue to launch new projects in the past,

75
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,320
in the next three quarters of this year, we expect the pace to pick up.

76
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,160
In terms of revenue, if you look on the overall basis, you can see that

77
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:04,400
it drops quite significantly. But if you look more into detail, which is the gray area,

78
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:12,480
the lighter shade and the darker shade, you can see that especially the darker shade is the sales

79
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:21,680
of real estates, meaning all those residential units that we transferred in the past quarter

80
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,960
and the quarter in the prior year. You could see that the momentum is picking up.

81
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:40,880
A small remark. In the first quarter of 2022, there was about 634 million baht in terms of

82
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,160
revenue. That was part of our, I would say, last activities in terms of balance sheet reform that

83
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:57,760
we have been talking about. We sell some piece of land bank, high potential land bank, to diversify

84
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:06,960
into other areas, as well as penetrating into new markets, which we were not able to penetrate

85
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:16,560
before. That's something that we have talked over many times already. I might not cover that in

86
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:28,880
detail. Financial results is basically, I kind of summarized that already, but maybe I'll pick

87
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:37,200
a few points here that I talked about it. The top line we talked about, the revenue from

88
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,720
construction contracts. I guess I'll expand on this a little bit. This line is basically

89
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:56,720
coming from construction, home construction service, because the way we sell the house,

90
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:06,800
part of our projects are built to order. Customers buy houses in two contracts, land purchase, as well

91
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:17,440
as home building construction contract. This line is basically the revenue that comes in from

92
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:27,520
construction of those built to order units. They come in installments. In the past, this line was

93
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:38,080
also revenue coming from our OEM service that we provide to other developers. We go out and build

94
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:50,320
houses using our pre-cast capabilities that we acquired through DAI Group. We use that capacity

95
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:58,880
to help prop up revenue on the construction service as well. The thing that has changed for

96
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,760
this year is that with the nine new projects that we are launching, we need all those capacities

97
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,400
to do it ourselves internally. That's why if you compare to the first quarter last year, you could

98
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:23,520
see a drop, because revenue from this line is basically from our own built to order units,

99
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,600
or what we call turnkey solution projects, which are all built to order houses.

100
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:38,400
The gross margin comes back to the more or less normal level, 34 percent, mid-30s,

101
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,640
as opposed to the first quarter last year, which was normally high because of that

102
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:54,560
land transaction, as I mentioned earlier. Distribution costs are basically in line with

103
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,200
revenue, but maybe slightly more because we are doing some more marketing activities for the

104
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:13,760
new projects that we are launching. Other than that, maybe financial costs,

105
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,880
it's much, much lower than prior year. That's basically a counting effect. When you start

106
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:34,080
developing the land, all those interest payments go back to being recognized as

107
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,480
basically interest capitalization, as opposed to being recognized as interest expense. That's the

108
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,600
only difference. We pay the same interest, different accounting treatment.

109
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:58,480
In terms of assets, I guess asset base hasn't changed that much from last year,

110
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,600
at the end of last year. Maybe only one line that has changed was the short-term loan to others.

111
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:15,120
That basically is a result of our strategic move to basically decide to apply the remaining 30

112
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,960
percent of Nobuna River, which is the asset holder for Banyan Tree Residences River site.

113
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:37,840
We become 100 percent owned of that project, which is also reflected here in the liability

114
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,680
and the equity side as well. I'll expand a little bit more on that. I guess

115
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:52,880
70 percent, the additional 30 percent that we acquired, the reason why I called it strategic

116
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,960
was that it was a mutual agreement with the partner that he wanted to exit, while we want

117
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:13,520
maybe a little bit more free-handed to manage the last 25 to 30 percent of the Banyan Tree

118
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:23,360
Residences inventory. This acquisition has some effect obviously on the asset side,

119
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:35,600
as well as on the equity side. The reduction in the non-controlling interest, that's what I'm

120
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:44,400
referring to, 341 million baht. That minority interest was eliminated because of the fact that

121
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,440
we own 100 percent of Nobuna River. That's basically it. The liabilities, I guess,

122
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:05,680
in total numbers, not much change, but in terms of mix of the debt portfolio, we got two new

123
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:19,680
debenture bonds, 950 million baht. 450, 465 varying about 6.4 percent coupon rate

124
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:32,720
due in 2024. The other 485 million baht, 6.7 percent coupon rate due in 2025.

125
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:41,760
So, that brings our net interest-bearing debt-to-equity up a little bit to 1.3.

126
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:52,000
As we mentioned our loan, I guess 1.1 was maybe a bit too low for a real estate company

127
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,600
that we are not leveraging enough. This is climbing back up a little bit.

128
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:10,800
In terms of outlook, the blue circles are the new projects that we plan to launch. We launch

129
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:17,840
two, which I'll cover in pictures in subsequent slides. This month, there will be another new

130
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:27,120
project, which is the high-rise in Rattanathibet, namely the most condominium. I guess the second

131
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:37,600
condominium under this brand basically is reaching down a little bit further into the

132
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,680
market that we were not addressing before.

133
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,320
Let's take back a little bit. The first two

134
00:20:48,960 --> 00:21:00,160
land at residential that we relaunched was Nwanathifine in Kunkeprita. It's actually the

135
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:10,080
second project in the Kunkeprita area. We launched the first Nwanathifine project in the Kunkeprita

136
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:20,400
area, I think in 2018, with about 170 plus units. We are now down to the last, I think,

137
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:33,360
under 20 units now. We want to keep this product in that area, so we acquired a smaller plot of

138
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:42,640
land and built a new Nwanathifine in the Kunkeprita area to continue that product mix

139
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:52,400
in Kunkeprita, which is our direction of doing township development in that area.

140
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:07,840
Nwana Absolute Kunkeprita was also launched last month. As I mentioned, now we have three

141
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:19,120
locations of Nwana Absolute. If you are a fan of Nwana Beyond, you could kind of relate very closely

142
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:28,320
to this new product. Basically, it's the same DNA of Nwana Beyond, but maybe a little bit less

143
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:41,600
in terms of decorations, for the lack of better words. It's more simplified. It's more

144
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:52,000
– what do you call it – less decoration, I guess. That's what I can think of right now.

145
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,440
But functionalities and space and the creativity in terms of design,

146
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:10,480
wind flow, blah, blah, it's still there. So being less decorated, price point could be

147
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:21,680
brought down so that we can have – reach down further into the customer spectrum on the bottom

148
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:34,400
side. Nwana Absolute Kunkeprita is a sizable project, about almost 2.4 billion baht in

149
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:45,040
project value, 127 units. So it is the largest of the first three Nwana Absolute series.

150
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:55,600
As you can see, the price range is about 11 to 20 million baht, as opposed to Nwana Beyond now is

151
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:06,480
25 to 40, 40 plus million baht. So you can see the difference in the price range.

152
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:20,000
This is just a picture of the launch day. And also, Nwana Defy, which I just talked about earlier,

153
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:32,400
this is the new and improved series. Prior to this, we did not have a roof garden like this,

154
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:43,040
but we realized that the pandemic has changed behavior somewhat. And even now,

155
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,360
I think some companies still make it optional for employees, for staff to work from home.

156
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:02,480
So we create all these spaces that provide that kind of flexibility. It's not just a rooftop

157
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,840
that you cannot actually use. This one, you can actually go out, you can have a garden,

158
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,200
you can do barbecue with your friends. You actually have a small air-conditioned room

159
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:23,680
on maybe one third of the floor plate on your rooftop, as you can see in the picture here.

160
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,400
So it's a new and improved product that we put out.

161
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,040
This is a look of the rooftop garden from the inside.

162
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,560
This is the indoor air-conditioned area, which I was talking about. This is a real picture,

163
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:54,720
not a perspective. This is the launch date. You can see that the fan base is coming back

164
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:02,560
as we open, as we launch a new project. Quite encouraging for us, actually,

165
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,960
when we come back to the market and the customer base is coming back to visit us.

166
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:22,320
This one is actually the top end of the product spectrum. We originally planned to launch it

167
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,720
within the second quarter, but I think right now, I think the team might want to shift it out a

168
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:38,000
little bit, maybe into the third quarter. But basically, it's the ultra luxury residences

169
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:48,640
segment. Three-story houses. Let's see if I have a bit more. No, no, no. I guess the team doesn't

170
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,080
want to steal the show before the product launch. Basically, it's a three-story houses,

171
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:05,040
but the size is about maybe double or triple of the one at Beyond. We're talking about 1,000

172
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:12,480
square meters of living space, so you have all the facilities rooms that you might imagine

173
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:22,880
in your own house. Spa room, living room, of course, but bedroom, bar room,

174
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,600
plenty of parking space, not only for your car, but also for your supercars.

175
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,120
The price range for this would be about 80 to 150 million baht. This would be

176
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:51,440
the crown jewel of the Nirvana Cowship Prunthepritha. It's the very top end. We put out this

177
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,120
as we believe that the very top end of the spectrum would be less impacted by any uncertainties in

178
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:15,600
terms of economic development. Our stronghold in terms of target market is in this segment already,

179
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:26,880
if you can relate Nirvana beyond. This is even higher. It's the ultra luxury segment as opposed

180
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:37,840
to value luxury segment, which I refer to Nirvana absolute. Those are for maybe more

181
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,520
value of money. That's probably the word I was looking for earlier.

182
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:53,120
I guess we would get to see the real thing in the next one or two months.

183
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:02,800
I think in the last part of June, there will be launched for this the most Ratana event.

184
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:14,400
Again, this is, I would say, second high-rise condominium for Nirvana. We are still very much

185
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:27,360
landed residential developer. We want to stay that way also. To have a better mix of revenues

186
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:36,160
and margins and customer base, we think that we should have some flavors of high-rise condominium

187
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:48,480
as well as a mix. But our condominium is not like other developers. Not necessarily

188
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:59,440
has to be next to the SkyTrain. We identify area that there's enough communities in that area.

189
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:10,640
The first, the most, condominium was in Isarapath area. That one was chosen because of Sivagrad

190
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:23,600
Hospital. We think that the medical personnel, including the students in that area, as well as

191
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:34,560
the families of those who are hospitalized in the Sivagrad Hospital, would need some sort of

192
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,880
dwelling space close enough to the hospital. That's why we acquired that land. We put out

193
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,520
a low-rise condominium and we practically sold out already for that condominium.

194
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:58,880
This one in Ratanathipet is a bit different. Not in the medical personnel, but more or less

195
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:08,560
of the existing communities surrounding the Ministry of Commerce in that area. It's quite

196
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:16,720
populated. It's quite dense. But there's not much, I wouldn't say no, but there's not much

197
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:27,520
high-rise residential available in that area. We decided to utilize this land, which has been on

198
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:37,840
our balance sheet for, I think, already about five or six years during the M&A acquisition with

199
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:49,680
Daith Group. We're developing into what we call a dual-space condominium. You would have the sense

200
00:31:49,680 --> 00:32:02,160
of two stories living in maybe about 80 to 90 square meters living space. There'll be a loft

201
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:09,920
that you can put up your bed up front, I mean on top. You can have a living space on the bottom

202
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:23,200
floor. With the double-space high ceiling, you get that wide area, which is more or less more

203
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:31,760
breathing room for you during your relaxation days in your own space. This would be about

204
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:40,480
five billion baht in terms of project value. It will be launched, I think, in the last week of June.

205
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,240
I guess the team has tried to come up with 100 functions, 100 lifetimes. So basically,

206
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,960
what they mean is that there would be plenty of activities in the facilities that you can

207
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:11,280
use. You name it, all those sports, all those running, all those lane, all those swimming

208
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:20,080
pool, fitness, and maybe badminton court, or maybe even barbecue space on the high floor

209
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,680
that you can go up and bring your friends and go barbecue on the top floor.

210
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,600
Those are the kind of facilities that we will put up to the customers. You can see that,

211
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:44,320
I guess, you can take 5.3 billion baht divided by the total of about 1.8 billion baht.

212
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,920
You can see that the entry level to Punnawana product has been brought down through this

213
00:33:51,920 --> 00:34:03,600
condominium. I guess since the inception, Punnawana was built based on a very specific target,

214
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,600
which is basically the segment that we call in real estate is the high-end segment.

215
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:19,680
So I think we feel that we left out some customers who might want to enjoy

216
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,480
Punnawana product, Punnawana DNA. They cannot afford, let's say, Punnawana Beyond or even

217
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:38,320
Punnawana Define, which is about 8 million baht townhouse. But this one is about 2 or 3 million

218
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:48,400
baht condominium unit, double space, Punnawana DNA. The whole enchilada is put into this about

219
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:56,880
80 to 90 square meters. It's an opportunity for those who might appreciate Punnawana products to

220
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:10,080
be able to enter into our Punnawana world. As for the administrative issues, I guess,

221
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:21,760
dividends is all done. We paid last month already, the year was about 3%. We have to retain some cash

222
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:33,200
to roll out the new project, as we mentioned. So the dividend is about 3%, which I think hopefully

223
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:44,080
is more acceptable for the shareholder base that we have. More importantly, probably, is the name

224
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:57,600
change. Nirvana Dayi was our name when Nirvana entered into the stock exchange, I would say.

225
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,640
Originally, we were called Nirvana Development already, prior to listing. It's a pure development

226
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:23,680
company. But M&A in 2017, when it was finalized, early 2017, we do an M&A with a listed company,

227
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:37,680
Dayi Group. So after the M&A, we changed Dayi Group into Nirvana Dayi. But now, the change back

228
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:45,040
to the Nirvana Development name is basically, we want to send the signal back to the market that

229
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:53,760
we want to refocus in development. If you follow Nirvana closely, you would see that

230
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:02,080
asset base is very, very much in qualities, high potential. But

231
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:11,680
the pandemic slowed us down for almost three years. We were not able to utilize those asset base.

232
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,840
In conjunction with this name change, in conjunction with the business direction that we

233
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:28,160
want to launch nine new projects in one year, highest in our history is basically the same

234
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:37,120
message that we want to send to the investment communities that we want to come back and focus

235
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:45,120
on development. The capacities that we have coming through Dayi Group would be used to support

236
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:55,840
ourselves in terms of development more than we use the extra capacities to provide service to

237
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:03,440
the others as we might have been in the past five years. The session has come to an end.

238
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,520
So on behalf of the Stock Exchange of Thailand, I would like to thank you investors and corporate

239
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,200
for joining the conference. We look forward to welcome you all again in the next quarter.

240
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,120
Thank you very much and have a good day.

241
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,560
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

242
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,560
Thank you.
