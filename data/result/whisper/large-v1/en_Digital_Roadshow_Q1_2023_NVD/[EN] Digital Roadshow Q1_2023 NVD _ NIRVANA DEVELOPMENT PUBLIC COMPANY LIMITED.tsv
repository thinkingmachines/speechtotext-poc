0	14840	Hello, good afternoon, investors and corporates. Welcome to ZDigital Roadshow first quarter
14840	22400	2023 performance review. This section will run about 45 minutes including Q&A. Company
22400	29680	will start the section by 30-minute presentation followed by 15-minute Q&A. And during Q&A,
30320	35200	investors may leave your question in the meeting room chat box or use the raise your hand function.
35840	40640	We will open your microphone so you can ask the questions to the company directly.
41360	48240	So may I now invite Nirvana Development, Patrick Company Limited, to start the presentation,
48240	53280	please. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction.
56320	64160	Good afternoon, everyone. I want to ask back to report, actually maybe to update. I guess
65280	73280	we talked about the first quarter results about maybe a month or two ago. This is our regular
73920	83440	digital roadshow that we provide updates for those who may not be in Bangkok. Okay.
85920	87600	Let me put up the slides.
87600	107200	Okay. Hopefully the slideshow comes up properly. Okay. I guess what happened in the first quarter
107760	119520	was that we began to roll out our business plan. We opened, we launched one project out of total
119520	125440	nine new projects that we planned for the year. The response was quite well received.
127040	135200	The result, the performance seems to be picking up the momentum especially when you compare to the
135760	147440	prior quarter, which reflected in the financial statements. The outlook, we're still moving on
148800	154560	our business plan for the year. We still have eight more new projects to launch
156320	164320	with the firm backlogs in our pockets. Other than that, I'll just go into the detail.
166160	176800	This is basically a recap of what we have communicated widely, publicly that this year
176800	186560	will be a year that we would reap benefit from our asset base. After two or three years of
186560	196320	hibernation, I would say, we did a couple of things fundamentally. We did a big restructuring in
196960	206000	2021 in terms of balance sheet management, also in terms of shareholding structure as well.
206880	218800	And during 2022, which we were still slowed down by the pandemic, we did a couple of reforms,
222320	230880	acquired a few pieces of new land, raw material, as well as the product development.
231680	238560	I think if you follow us closely, you might have seen some brand new product, which we
238560	247040	will prepare to show in this presentation as well. So for reaping the value forward,
247040	254400	means nine projects earmarked for this year, about 21 billion baht in project values,
254400	263600	combined project values. Some new products coming in, particularly the very top end,
263600	272320	Novana Collection and Novana Absolute, and a return of Novana at Work home office product,
272320	281040	which we haven't launched new project for a while already. There would be a launch of two
281040	287760	high-rise condominiums as well. I will go into detail maybe toward the end of the presentation.
288640	299120	And lastly, Novana Porsche Lifestyle Mall. That would be a retail, commercial retail space
299760	307600	to basically fulfill the township development that we have planned for Phuket Greta.
311040	322800	Okay, a recap of nine projects, 21 billion baht. We plan to launch three single detached house
322800	330960	projects. Novana Collection, Novana Absolute, Novana Absolute in two locations, Phuket Greta
330960	340800	and Ekamai Ramintra. One townhouse project, Novana Define, is a new and improved product
340800	349200	that responds more to the change in behavior post the pandemic. Condominium, as I mentioned,
349200	360960	two high-rise, one in Ratanathibet area and one in the center of Bangkok CBD. And home office,
360960	370160	there would be about two or three projects coming up this year. In the first quarter, we launched
370960	381120	our Novana Absolute in the second location of this series. If you remember, I think in the
382000	389680	second half of last year, we launched Novana Absolute in Bangna. But this one is in Ekamai Ramintra.
389680	404640	It's not a very big project, but the product itself fits in this area very, very well.
406000	413520	The response was quite encouraging. Although the number doesn't seem so big,
413520	424240	but the pace of sales, basically we're about over 40% in the first quarter during the launch,
424240	436960	the first weekend actually at the launch. So it's a brand new series of single houses. If you notice
436960	446080	that the second story has an outdoor area with green trees and double volume all the way up to
446080	457520	the third floor with some concrete blocks that give you some sort of privacy rather than normal
457520	465760	veranda or a balcony. So this is what we put out into the market. This is the way,
465760	470880	the other view of it, looking out from the inside of the house, you can see that you can actually
470880	481280	use the outdoor space with the privacy that you might need. And indoor, there would be some,
484320	493760	I guess, if you have Japanese space, this would be a dining table. But for us here in Thailand,
494400	502960	it could be used as a living area, be used for working from home area. You can imagine that
502960	508240	when you do a conference call online, there would be no one walking in the back.
508880	514560	So you get that professional look through your online teleconferencing.
514800	522240	This is basically the, we picked some pictures of the launch date. So it was quite well received,
522240	526320	as I mentioned, about almost 50%. So, you know, in one weekend.
530320	536800	Operationally, as I mentioned, we launched only one to start off with during the first quarter,
537280	545840	during the first quarter, three projects coming up this quarter. And so we total
547840	557680	project, total active projects about 12 projects. The pre-sales from the beginning of,
558480	565200	yeah, during the first quarter is about a billion baht. Revenue was not that strong,
566000	573200	but comparing to the prior quarter is a good sign, good recovery after sobering from the
573200	587680	pandemic effect. To recap of those 12 active projects, as I mentioned, the total backlog
588320	595760	combining with the carrying forward backlog from the end of the year, plus the new pre-sales,
596320	607840	minus the transfer, we net at about almost 1.3 billion baht in terms of backlogs. The 12 projects
607840	615440	combined estimate around 12.5 billion baht available for sales.
617680	628960	Out of the 1 billion baht pre-sales, you can see that the pre-sale pace is roughly around the same
628960	639600	as the fourth quarter. As a small remark that we had not opened, had not launched new projects
639600	649360	for the past, I would say, almost nine quarters. During the pandemic, we lay low. We adjust more
649360	656720	fundamentals so that we could survive and stay afloat. So we were forced to
657840	664560	sales whatever left in the portfolio. And basically those old projects that are running
664560	672560	in the background. But we started to launch new projects in the fourth quarter of 2022.
672560	678800	That's how we achieved the 1 billion baht roughly pre-sales quarter,
680240	687120	which is a good sign. That means customer base is still there. When we come back to the market,
687680	698560	the response was quite well received. And as we continue to launch new projects in the past,
699440	706320	in the next three quarters of this year, we expect the pace to pick up.
709920	716160	In terms of revenue, if you look on the overall basis, you can see that
716160	724400	it drops quite significantly. But if you look more into detail, which is the gray area,
724400	732480	the lighter shade and the darker shade, you can see that especially the darker shade is the sales
732480	741680	of real estates, meaning all those residential units that we transferred in the past quarter
741680	748960	and the quarter in the prior year. You could see that the momentum is picking up.
752400	760880	A small remark. In the first quarter of 2022, there was about 634 million baht in terms of
760880	768160	revenue. That was part of our, I would say, last activities in terms of balance sheet reform that
768160	777760	we have been talking about. We sell some piece of land bank, high potential land bank, to diversify
777760	786960	into other areas, as well as penetrating into new markets, which we were not able to penetrate
786960	796560	before. That's something that we have talked over many times already. I might not cover that in
796560	808880	detail. Financial results is basically, I kind of summarized that already, but maybe I'll pick
808880	817200	a few points here that I talked about it. The top line we talked about, the revenue from
817200	824720	construction contracts. I guess I'll expand on this a little bit. This line is basically
826640	836720	coming from construction, home construction service, because the way we sell the house,
836720	846800	part of our projects are built to order. Customers buy houses in two contracts, land purchase, as well
846800	857440	as home building construction contract. This line is basically the revenue that comes in from
858000	867520	construction of those built to order units. They come in installments. In the past, this line was
867520	878080	also revenue coming from our OEM service that we provide to other developers. We go out and build
879520	890320	houses using our pre-cast capabilities that we acquired through DAI Group. We use that capacity
890800	898880	to help prop up revenue on the construction service as well. The thing that has changed for
898880	905760	this year is that with the nine new projects that we are launching, we need all those capacities
906560	914400	to do it ourselves internally. That's why if you compare to the first quarter last year, you could
914400	923520	see a drop, because revenue from this line is basically from our own built to order units,
923520	929600	or what we call turnkey solution projects, which are all built to order houses.
931840	938400	The gross margin comes back to the more or less normal level, 34 percent, mid-30s,
939040	944640	as opposed to the first quarter last year, which was normally high because of that
946320	954560	land transaction, as I mentioned earlier. Distribution costs are basically in line with
955600	963200	revenue, but maybe slightly more because we are doing some more marketing activities for the
963200	973760	new projects that we are launching. Other than that, maybe financial costs,
975120	982880	it's much, much lower than prior year. That's basically a counting effect. When you start
983600	994080	developing the land, all those interest payments go back to being recognized as
995120	1002480	basically interest capitalization, as opposed to being recognized as interest expense. That's the
1002480	1009600	only difference. We pay the same interest, different accounting treatment.
1010480	1018480	In terms of assets, I guess asset base hasn't changed that much from last year,
1019120	1025600	at the end of last year. Maybe only one line that has changed was the short-term loan to others.
1026160	1035120	That basically is a result of our strategic move to basically decide to apply the remaining 30
1035120	1042960	percent of Nobuna River, which is the asset holder for Banyan Tree Residences River site.
1044320	1057840	We become 100 percent owned of that project, which is also reflected here in the liability
1057840	1063680	and the equity side as well. I'll expand a little bit more on that. I guess
1064800	1072880	70 percent, the additional 30 percent that we acquired, the reason why I called it strategic
1072880	1080960	was that it was a mutual agreement with the partner that he wanted to exit, while we want
1081920	1093520	maybe a little bit more free-handed to manage the last 25 to 30 percent of the Banyan Tree
1093520	1103360	Residences inventory. This acquisition has some effect obviously on the asset side,
1104320	1115600	as well as on the equity side. The reduction in the non-controlling interest, that's what I'm
1115600	1124400	referring to, 341 million baht. That minority interest was eliminated because of the fact that
1124400	1131440	we own 100 percent of Nobuna River. That's basically it. The liabilities, I guess,
1133280	1145680	in total numbers, not much change, but in terms of mix of the debt portfolio, we got two new
1145680	1159680	debenture bonds, 950 million baht. 450, 465 varying about 6.4 percent coupon rate
1161120	1172720	due in 2024. The other 485 million baht, 6.7 percent coupon rate due in 2025.
1173600	1181760	So, that brings our net interest-bearing debt-to-equity up a little bit to 1.3.
1183840	1192000	As we mentioned our loan, I guess 1.1 was maybe a bit too low for a real estate company
1192560	1197600	that we are not leveraging enough. This is climbing back up a little bit.
1197600	1210800	In terms of outlook, the blue circles are the new projects that we plan to launch. We launch
1210800	1217840	two, which I'll cover in pictures in subsequent slides. This month, there will be another new
1217840	1227120	project, which is the high-rise in Rattanathibet, namely the most condominium. I guess the second
1227600	1237600	condominium under this brand basically is reaching down a little bit further into the
1239360	1241680	market that we were not addressing before.
1244800	1248320	Let's take back a little bit. The first two
1248960	1260160	land at residential that we relaunched was Nwanathifine in Kunkeprita. It's actually the
1260160	1270080	second project in the Kunkeprita area. We launched the first Nwanathifine project in the Kunkeprita
1270080	1280400	area, I think in 2018, with about 170 plus units. We are now down to the last, I think,
1280400	1293360	under 20 units now. We want to keep this product in that area, so we acquired a smaller plot of
1293360	1302640	land and built a new Nwanathifine in the Kunkeprita area to continue that product mix
1302640	1312400	in Kunkeprita, which is our direction of doing township development in that area.
1312400	1327840	Nwana Absolute Kunkeprita was also launched last month. As I mentioned, now we have three
1329040	1339120	locations of Nwana Absolute. If you are a fan of Nwana Beyond, you could kind of relate very closely
1339120	1348320	to this new product. Basically, it's the same DNA of Nwana Beyond, but maybe a little bit less
1348960	1361600	in terms of decorations, for the lack of better words. It's more simplified. It's more
1361600	1372000	– what do you call it – less decoration, I guess. That's what I can think of right now.
1372960	1379440	But functionalities and space and the creativity in terms of design,
1379440	1390480	wind flow, blah, blah, it's still there. So being less decorated, price point could be
1391360	1401680	brought down so that we can have – reach down further into the customer spectrum on the bottom
1401680	1414400	side. Nwana Absolute Kunkeprita is a sizable project, about almost 2.4 billion baht in
1414400	1425040	project value, 127 units. So it is the largest of the first three Nwana Absolute series.
1425040	1435600	As you can see, the price range is about 11 to 20 million baht, as opposed to Nwana Beyond now is
1436480	1446480	25 to 40, 40 plus million baht. So you can see the difference in the price range.
1446480	1460000	This is just a picture of the launch day. And also, Nwana Defy, which I just talked about earlier,
1461520	1472400	this is the new and improved series. Prior to this, we did not have a roof garden like this,
1473120	1483040	but we realized that the pandemic has changed behavior somewhat. And even now,
1483600	1491360	I think some companies still make it optional for employees, for staff to work from home.
1492000	1502480	So we create all these spaces that provide that kind of flexibility. It's not just a rooftop
1502480	1509840	that you cannot actually use. This one, you can actually go out, you can have a garden,
1509840	1515200	you can do barbecue with your friends. You actually have a small air-conditioned room
1515760	1523680	on maybe one third of the floor plate on your rooftop, as you can see in the picture here.
1526160	1530400	So it's a new and improved product that we put out.
1534560	1539040	This is a look of the rooftop garden from the inside.
1539040	1544560	This is the indoor air-conditioned area, which I was talking about. This is a real picture,
1544560	1554720	not a perspective. This is the launch date. You can see that the fan base is coming back
1554720	1562560	as we open, as we launch a new project. Quite encouraging for us, actually,
1562560	1568960	when we come back to the market and the customer base is coming back to visit us.
1572080	1582320	This one is actually the top end of the product spectrum. We originally planned to launch it
1582320	1588720	within the second quarter, but I think right now, I think the team might want to shift it out a
1588720	1598000	little bit, maybe into the third quarter. But basically, it's the ultra luxury residences
1598000	1608640	segment. Three-story houses. Let's see if I have a bit more. No, no, no. I guess the team doesn't
1608640	1616080	want to steal the show before the product launch. Basically, it's a three-story houses,
1616720	1625040	but the size is about maybe double or triple of the one at Beyond. We're talking about 1,000
1625040	1632480	square meters of living space, so you have all the facilities rooms that you might imagine
1632960	1642880	in your own house. Spa room, living room, of course, but bedroom, bar room,
1643920	1649600	plenty of parking space, not only for your car, but also for your supercars.
1652720	1659120	The price range for this would be about 80 to 150 million baht. This would be
1659840	1671440	the crown jewel of the Nirvana Cowship Prunthepritha. It's the very top end. We put out this
1674000	1683120	as we believe that the very top end of the spectrum would be less impacted by any uncertainties in
1683120	1695600	terms of economic development. Our stronghold in terms of target market is in this segment already,
1697040	1706880	if you can relate Nirvana beyond. This is even higher. It's the ultra luxury segment as opposed
1706880	1717840	to value luxury segment, which I refer to Nirvana absolute. Those are for maybe more
1717840	1721520	value of money. That's probably the word I was looking for earlier.
1726560	1733120	I guess we would get to see the real thing in the next one or two months.
1733760	1742800	I think in the last part of June, there will be launched for this the most Ratana event.
1743920	1754400	Again, this is, I would say, second high-rise condominium for Nirvana. We are still very much
1754400	1767360	landed residential developer. We want to stay that way also. To have a better mix of revenues
1767360	1776160	and margins and customer base, we think that we should have some flavors of high-rise condominium
1776160	1788480	as well as a mix. But our condominium is not like other developers. Not necessarily
1788480	1799440	has to be next to the SkyTrain. We identify area that there's enough communities in that area.
1800240	1810640	The first, the most, condominium was in Isarapath area. That one was chosen because of Sivagrad
1810640	1823600	Hospital. We think that the medical personnel, including the students in that area, as well as
1824240	1834560	the families of those who are hospitalized in the Sivagrad Hospital, would need some sort of
1835680	1842880	dwelling space close enough to the hospital. That's why we acquired that land. We put out
1843920	1849520	a low-rise condominium and we practically sold out already for that condominium.
1850320	1858880	This one in Ratanathipet is a bit different. Not in the medical personnel, but more or less
1858880	1868560	of the existing communities surrounding the Ministry of Commerce in that area. It's quite
1868560	1876720	populated. It's quite dense. But there's not much, I wouldn't say no, but there's not much
1877600	1887520	high-rise residential available in that area. We decided to utilize this land, which has been on
1887520	1897840	our balance sheet for, I think, already about five or six years during the M&A acquisition with
1897840	1909680	Daith Group. We're developing into what we call a dual-space condominium. You would have the sense
1909680	1922160	of two stories living in maybe about 80 to 90 square meters living space. There'll be a loft
1922160	1929920	that you can put up your bed up front, I mean on top. You can have a living space on the bottom
1929920	1943200	floor. With the double-space high ceiling, you get that wide area, which is more or less more
1943200	1951760	breathing room for you during your relaxation days in your own space. This would be about
1951760	1960480	five billion baht in terms of project value. It will be launched, I think, in the last week of June.
1965920	1972240	I guess the team has tried to come up with 100 functions, 100 lifetimes. So basically,
1972240	1978960	what they mean is that there would be plenty of activities in the facilities that you can
1980160	1991280	use. You name it, all those sports, all those running, all those lane, all those swimming
1991280	2000080	pool, fitness, and maybe badminton court, or maybe even barbecue space on the high floor
2000800	2007680	that you can go up and bring your friends and go barbecue on the top floor.
2008880	2015600	Those are the kind of facilities that we will put up to the customers. You can see that,
2016640	2024320	I guess, you can take 5.3 billion baht divided by the total of about 1.8 billion baht.
2024320	2031920	You can see that the entry level to Punnawana product has been brought down through this
2031920	2043600	condominium. I guess since the inception, Punnawana was built based on a very specific target,
2045040	2051600	which is basically the segment that we call in real estate is the high-end segment.
2052400	2059680	So I think we feel that we left out some customers who might want to enjoy
2060880	2068480	Punnawana product, Punnawana DNA. They cannot afford, let's say, Punnawana Beyond or even
2068480	2078320	Punnawana Define, which is about 8 million baht townhouse. But this one is about 2 or 3 million
2078320	2088400	baht condominium unit, double space, Punnawana DNA. The whole enchilada is put into this about
2088400	2096880	80 to 90 square meters. It's an opportunity for those who might appreciate Punnawana products to
2096880	2110080	be able to enter into our Punnawana world. As for the administrative issues, I guess,
2110080	2121760	dividends is all done. We paid last month already, the year was about 3%. We have to retain some cash
2121840	2133200	to roll out the new project, as we mentioned. So the dividend is about 3%, which I think hopefully
2133200	2144080	is more acceptable for the shareholder base that we have. More importantly, probably, is the name
2144080	2157600	change. Nirvana Dayi was our name when Nirvana entered into the stock exchange, I would say.
2160000	2168640	Originally, we were called Nirvana Development already, prior to listing. It's a pure development
2168640	2183680	company. But M&A in 2017, when it was finalized, early 2017, we do an M&A with a listed company,
2184480	2197680	Dayi Group. So after the M&A, we changed Dayi Group into Nirvana Dayi. But now, the change back
2197680	2205040	to the Nirvana Development name is basically, we want to send the signal back to the market that
2205040	2213760	we want to refocus in development. If you follow Nirvana closely, you would see that
2214720	2222080	asset base is very, very much in qualities, high potential. But
2222080	2231680	the pandemic slowed us down for almost three years. We were not able to utilize those asset base.
2233440	2239840	In conjunction with this name change, in conjunction with the business direction that we
2239840	2248160	want to launch nine new projects in one year, highest in our history is basically the same
2248160	2257120	message that we want to send to the investment communities that we want to come back and focus
2257120	2265120	on development. The capacities that we have coming through Dayi Group would be used to support
2266480	2275840	ourselves in terms of development more than we use the extra capacities to provide service to
2275840	2283440	the others as we might have been in the past five years. The session has come to an end.
2283440	2289520	So on behalf of the Stock Exchange of Thailand, I would like to thank you investors and corporate
2289520	2295200	for joining the conference. We look forward to welcome you all again in the next quarter.
2295280	2297120	Thank you very much and have a good day.
2300000	2302560	Thank you so much. Goodbye.
2325200	2332560	Thank you.
