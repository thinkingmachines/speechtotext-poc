Hello, good afternoon, investors and corporates. Welcome to ZDigital Roadshow first quarter

00:14.840 --> 00:22.400
2023 performance review. This section will run about 45 minutes including Q&A. Company

00:22.400 --> 00:29.680
will start the section by 30-minute presentation followed by 15-minute Q&A. And during Q&A,

00:30.320 --> 00:35.200
investors may leave your question in the meeting room chat box or use the raise your hand function.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.640
We will open your microphone so you can ask the questions to the company directly.

00:41.360 --> 00:48.240
So may I now invite Nirvana Development, Patrick Company Limited, to start the presentation,

00:48.240 --> 00:53.280
please. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction.

00:56.320 --> 01:04.160
Good afternoon, everyone. I want to ask back to report, actually maybe to update. I guess

01:05.280 --> 01:13.280
we talked about the first quarter results about maybe a month or two ago. This is our regular

01:13.920 --> 01:23.440
digital roadshow that we provide updates for those who may not be in Bangkok. Okay.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.600
Let me put up the slides.

01:27.600 --> 01:47.200
Okay. Hopefully the slideshow comes up properly. Okay. I guess what happened in the first quarter

01:47.760 --> 01:59.520
was that we began to roll out our business plan. We opened, we launched one project out of total

01:59.520 --> 02:05.440
nine new projects that we planned for the year. The response was quite well received.

02:07.040 --> 02:15.200
The result, the performance seems to be picking up the momentum especially when you compare to the

02:15.760 --> 02:27.440
prior quarter, which reflected in the financial statements. The outlook, we're still moving on

02:28.800 --> 02:34.560
our business plan for the year. We still have eight more new projects to launch

02:36.320 --> 02:44.320
with the firm backlogs in our pockets. Other than that, I'll just go into the detail.

02:46.160 --> 02:56.800
This is basically a recap of what we have communicated widely, publicly that this year

02:56.800 --> 03:06.560
will be a year that we would reap benefit from our asset base. After two or three years of

03:06.560 --> 03:16.320
hibernation, I would say, we did a couple of things fundamentally. We did a big restructuring in

03:16.960 --> 03:26.000
2021 in terms of balance sheet management, also in terms of shareholding structure as well.

03:26.880 --> 03:38.800
And during 2022, which we were still slowed down by the pandemic, we did a couple of reforms,

03:42.320 --> 03:50.880
acquired a few pieces of new land, raw material, as well as the product development.

03:51.680 --> 03:58.560
I think if you follow us closely, you might have seen some brand new product, which we

03:58.560 --> 04:07.040
will prepare to show in this presentation as well. So for reaping the value forward,

04:07.040 --> 04:14.400
means nine projects earmarked for this year, about 21 billion baht in project values,

04:14.400 --> 04:23.600
combined project values. Some new products coming in, particularly the very top end,

04:23.600 --> 04:32.320
Novana Collection and Novana Absolute, and a return of Novana at Work home office product,

04:32.320 --> 04:41.040
which we haven't launched new project for a while already. There would be a launch of two

04:41.040 --> 04:47.760
high-rise condominiums as well. I will go into detail maybe toward the end of the presentation.

04:48.640 --> 04:59.120
And lastly, Novana Porsche Lifestyle Mall. That would be a retail, commercial retail space

04:59.760 --> 05:07.600
to basically fulfill the township development that we have planned for Phuket Greta.

05:11.040 --> 05:22.800
Okay, a recap of nine projects, 21 billion baht. We plan to launch three single detached house

05:22.800 --> 05:30.960
projects. Novana Collection, Novana Absolute, Novana Absolute in two locations, Phuket Greta

05:30.960 --> 05:40.800
and Ekamai Ramintra. One townhouse project, Novana Define, is a new and improved product

05:40.800 --> 05:49.200
that responds more to the change in behavior post the pandemic. Condominium, as I mentioned,

05:49.200 --> 06:00.960
two high-rise, one in Ratanathibet area and one in the center of Bangkok CBD. And home office,

06:00.960 --> 06:10.160
there would be about two or three projects coming up this year. In the first quarter, we launched

06:10.960 --> 06:21.120
our Novana Absolute in the second location of this series. If you remember, I think in the

06:22.000 --> 06:29.680
second half of last year, we launched Novana Absolute in Bangna. But this one is in Ekamai Ramintra.

06:29.680 --> 06:44.640
It's not a very big project, but the product itself fits in this area very, very well.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.520
The response was quite encouraging. Although the number doesn't seem so big,

06:53.520 --> 07:04.240
but the pace of sales, basically we're about over 40% in the first quarter during the launch,

07:04.240 --> 07:16.960
the first weekend actually at the launch. So it's a brand new series of single houses. If you notice

07:16.960 --> 07:26.080
that the second story has an outdoor area with green trees and double volume all the way up to

07:26.080 --> 07:37.520
the third floor with some concrete blocks that give you some sort of privacy rather than normal

07:37.520 --> 07:45.760
veranda or a balcony. So this is what we put out into the market. This is the way,

07:45.760 --> 07:50.880
the other view of it, looking out from the inside of the house, you can see that you can actually

07:50.880 --> 08:01.280
use the outdoor space with the privacy that you might need. And indoor, there would be some,

08:04.320 --> 08:13.760
I guess, if you have Japanese space, this would be a dining table. But for us here in Thailand,

08:14.400 --> 08:22.960
it could be used as a living area, be used for working from home area. You can imagine that

08:22.960 --> 08:28.240
when you do a conference call online, there would be no one walking in the back.

08:28.880 --> 08:34.560
So you get that professional look through your online teleconferencing.

08:34.800 --> 08:42.240
This is basically the, we picked some pictures of the launch date. So it was quite well received,

08:42.240 --> 08:46.320
as I mentioned, about almost 50%. So, you know, in one weekend.

08:50.320 --> 08:56.800
Operationally, as I mentioned, we launched only one to start off with during the first quarter,

08:57.280 --> 09:05.840
during the first quarter, three projects coming up this quarter. And so we total

09:07.840 --> 09:17.680
project, total active projects about 12 projects. The pre-sales from the beginning of,

09:18.480 --> 09:25.200
yeah, during the first quarter is about a billion baht. Revenue was not that strong,

09:26.000 --> 09:33.200
but comparing to the prior quarter is a good sign, good recovery after sobering from the

09:33.200 --> 09:47.680
pandemic effect. To recap of those 12 active projects, as I mentioned, the total backlog

09:48.320 --> 09:55.760
combining with the carrying forward backlog from the end of the year, plus the new pre-sales,

09:56.320 --> 10:07.840
minus the transfer, we net at about almost 1.3 billion baht in terms of backlogs. The 12 projects

10:07.840 --> 10:15.440
combined estimate around 12.5 billion baht available for sales.

10:17.680 --> 10:28.960
Out of the 1 billion baht pre-sales, you can see that the pre-sale pace is roughly around the same

10:28.960 --> 10:39.600
as the fourth quarter. As a small remark that we had not opened, had not launched new projects

10:39.600 --> 10:49.360
for the past, I would say, almost nine quarters. During the pandemic, we lay low. We adjust more

10:49.360 --> 10:56.720
fundamentals so that we could survive and stay afloat. So we were forced to

10:57.840 --> 11:04.560
sales whatever left in the portfolio. And basically those old projects that are running

11:04.560 --> 11:12.560
in the background. But we started to launch new projects in the fourth quarter of 2022.

11:12.560 --> 11:18.800
That's how we achieved the 1 billion baht roughly pre-sales quarter,

11:20.240 --> 11:27.120
which is a good sign. That means customer base is still there. When we come back to the market,

11:27.680 --> 11:38.560
the response was quite well received. And as we continue to launch new projects in the past,

11:39.440 --> 11:46.320
in the next three quarters of this year, we expect the pace to pick up.

11:49.920 --> 11:56.160
In terms of revenue, if you look on the overall basis, you can see that

11:56.160 --> 12:04.400
it drops quite significantly. But if you look more into detail, which is the gray area,

12:04.400 --> 12:12.480
the lighter shade and the darker shade, you can see that especially the darker shade is the sales

12:12.480 --> 12:21.680
of real estates, meaning all those residential units that we transferred in the past quarter

12:21.680 --> 12:28.960
and the quarter in the prior year. You could see that the momentum is picking up.

12:32.400 --> 12:40.880
A small remark. In the first quarter of 2022, there was about 634 million baht in terms of

12:40.880 --> 12:48.160
revenue. That was part of our, I would say, last activities in terms of balance sheet reform that

12:48.160 --> 12:57.760
we have been talking about. We sell some piece of land bank, high potential land bank, to diversify

12:57.760 --> 13:06.960
into other areas, as well as penetrating into new markets, which we were not able to penetrate

13:06.960 --> 13:16.560
before. That's something that we have talked over many times already. I might not cover that in

13:16.560 --> 13:28.880
detail. Financial results is basically, I kind of summarized that already, but maybe I'll pick

13:28.880 --> 13:37.200
a few points here that I talked about it. The top line we talked about, the revenue from

13:37.200 --> 13:44.720
construction contracts. I guess I'll expand on this a little bit. This line is basically

13:46.640 --> 13:56.720
coming from construction, home construction service, because the way we sell the house,

13:56.720 --> 14:06.800
part of our projects are built to order. Customers buy houses in two contracts, land purchase, as well

14:06.800 --> 14:17.440
as home building construction contract. This line is basically the revenue that comes in from

14:18.000 --> 14:27.520
construction of those built to order units. They come in installments. In the past, this line was

14:27.520 --> 14:38.080
also revenue coming from our OEM service that we provide to other developers. We go out and build

14:39.520 --> 14:50.320
houses using our pre-cast capabilities that we acquired through DAI Group. We use that capacity

14:50.800 --> 14:58.880
to help prop up revenue on the construction service as well. The thing that has changed for

14:58.880 --> 15:05.760
this year is that with the nine new projects that we are launching, we need all those capacities

15:06.560 --> 15:14.400
to do it ourselves internally. That's why if you compare to the first quarter last year, you could

15:14.400 --> 15:23.520
see a drop, because revenue from this line is basically from our own built to order units,

15:23.520 --> 15:29.600
or what we call turnkey solution projects, which are all built to order houses.

15:31.840 --> 15:38.400
The gross margin comes back to the more or less normal level, 34 percent, mid-30s,

15:39.040 --> 15:44.640
as opposed to the first quarter last year, which was normally high because of that

15:46.320 --> 15:54.560
land transaction, as I mentioned earlier. Distribution costs are basically in line with

15:55.600 --> 16:03.200
revenue, but maybe slightly more because we are doing some more marketing activities for the

16:03.200 --> 16:13.760
new projects that we are launching. Other than that, maybe financial costs,

16:15.120 --> 16:22.880
it's much, much lower than prior year. That's basically a counting effect. When you start

16:23.600 --> 16:34.080
developing the land, all those interest payments go back to being recognized as

16:35.120 --> 16:42.480
basically interest capitalization, as opposed to being recognized as interest expense. That's the

16:42.480 --> 16:49.600
only difference. We pay the same interest, different accounting treatment.

16:50.480 --> 16:58.480
In terms of assets, I guess asset base hasn't changed that much from last year,

16:59.120 --> 17:05.600
at the end of last year. Maybe only one line that has changed was the short-term loan to others.

17:06.160 --> 17:15.120
That basically is a result of our strategic move to basically decide to apply the remaining 30

17:15.120 --> 17:22.960
percent of Nobuna River, which is the asset holder for Banyan Tree Residences River site.

17:24.320 --> 17:37.840
We become 100 percent owned of that project, which is also reflected here in the liability

17:37.840 --> 17:43.680
and the equity side as well. I'll expand a little bit more on that. I guess

17:44.800 --> 17:52.880
70 percent, the additional 30 percent that we acquired, the reason why I called it strategic

17:52.880 --> 18:00.960
was that it was a mutual agreement with the partner that he wanted to exit, while we want

18:01.920 --> 18:13.520
maybe a little bit more free-handed to manage the last 25 to 30 percent of the Banyan Tree

18:13.520 --> 18:23.360
Residences inventory. This acquisition has some effect obviously on the asset side,

18:24.320 --> 18:35.600
as well as on the equity side. The reduction in the non-controlling interest, that's what I'm

18:35.600 --> 18:44.400
referring to, 341 million baht. That minority interest was eliminated because of the fact that

18:44.400 --> 18:51.440
we own 100 percent of Nobuna River. That's basically it. The liabilities, I guess,

18:53.280 --> 19:05.680
in total numbers, not much change, but in terms of mix of the debt portfolio, we got two new

19:05.680 --> 19:19.680
debenture bonds, 950 million baht. 450, 465 varying about 6.4 percent coupon rate

19:21.120 --> 19:32.720
due in 2024. The other 485 million baht, 6.7 percent coupon rate due in 2025.

19:33.600 --> 19:41.760
So, that brings our net interest-bearing debt-to-equity up a little bit to 1.3.

19:43.840 --> 19:52.000
As we mentioned our loan, I guess 1.1 was maybe a bit too low for a real estate company

19:52.560 --> 19:57.600
that we are not leveraging enough. This is climbing back up a little bit.

19:57.600 --> 20:10.800
In terms of outlook, the blue circles are the new projects that we plan to launch. We launch

20:10.800 --> 20:17.840
two, which I'll cover in pictures in subsequent slides. This month, there will be another new

20:17.840 --> 20:27.120
project, which is the high-rise in Rattanathibet, namely the most condominium. I guess the second

20:27.600 --> 20:37.600
condominium under this brand basically is reaching down a little bit further into the

20:39.360 --> 20:41.680
market that we were not addressing before.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.320
Let's take back a little bit. The first two

20:48.960 --> 21:00.160
land at residential that we relaunched was Nwanathifine in Kunkeprita. It's actually the

21:00.160 --> 21:10.080
second project in the Kunkeprita area. We launched the first Nwanathifine project in the Kunkeprita

21:10.080 --> 21:20.400
area, I think in 2018, with about 170 plus units. We are now down to the last, I think,

21:20.400 --> 21:33.360
under 20 units now. We want to keep this product in that area, so we acquired a smaller plot of

21:33.360 --> 21:42.640
land and built a new Nwanathifine in the Kunkeprita area to continue that product mix

21:42.640 --> 21:52.400
in Kunkeprita, which is our direction of doing township development in that area.

21:52.400 --> 22:07.840
Nwana Absolute Kunkeprita was also launched last month. As I mentioned, now we have three

22:09.040 --> 22:19.120
locations of Nwana Absolute. If you are a fan of Nwana Beyond, you could kind of relate very closely

22:19.120 --> 22:28.320
to this new product. Basically, it's the same DNA of Nwana Beyond, but maybe a little bit less

22:28.960 --> 22:41.600
in terms of decorations, for the lack of better words. It's more simplified. It's more

22:41.600 --> 22:52.000
– what do you call it – less decoration, I guess. That's what I can think of right now.

22:52.960 --> 22:59.440
But functionalities and space and the creativity in terms of design,

22:59.440 --> 23:10.480
wind flow, blah, blah, it's still there. So being less decorated, price point could be

23:11.360 --> 23:21.680
brought down so that we can have – reach down further into the customer spectrum on the bottom

23:21.680 --> 23:34.400
side. Nwana Absolute Kunkeprita is a sizable project, about almost 2.4 billion baht in

23:34.400 --> 23:45.040
project value, 127 units. So it is the largest of the first three Nwana Absolute series.

23:45.040 --> 23:55.600
As you can see, the price range is about 11 to 20 million baht, as opposed to Nwana Beyond now is

23:56.480 --> 24:06.480
25 to 40, 40 plus million baht. So you can see the difference in the price range.

24:06.480 --> 24:20.000
This is just a picture of the launch day. And also, Nwana Defy, which I just talked about earlier,

24:21.520 --> 24:32.400
this is the new and improved series. Prior to this, we did not have a roof garden like this,

24:33.120 --> 24:43.040
but we realized that the pandemic has changed behavior somewhat. And even now,

24:43.600 --> 24:51.360
I think some companies still make it optional for employees, for staff to work from home.

24:52.000 --> 25:02.480
So we create all these spaces that provide that kind of flexibility. It's not just a rooftop

25:02.480 --> 25:09.840
that you cannot actually use. This one, you can actually go out, you can have a garden,

25:09.840 --> 25:15.200
you can do barbecue with your friends. You actually have a small air-conditioned room

25:15.760 --> 25:23.680
on maybe one third of the floor plate on your rooftop, as you can see in the picture here.

25:26.160 --> 25:30.400
So it's a new and improved product that we put out.

25:34.560 --> 25:39.040
This is a look of the rooftop garden from the inside.

25:39.040 --> 25:44.560
This is the indoor air-conditioned area, which I was talking about. This is a real picture,

25:44.560 --> 25:54.720
not a perspective. This is the launch date. You can see that the fan base is coming back

25:54.720 --> 26:02.560
as we open, as we launch a new project. Quite encouraging for us, actually,

26:02.560 --> 26:08.960
when we come back to the market and the customer base is coming back to visit us.

26:12.080 --> 26:22.320
This one is actually the top end of the product spectrum. We originally planned to launch it

26:22.320 --> 26:28.720
within the second quarter, but I think right now, I think the team might want to shift it out a

26:28.720 --> 26:38.000
little bit, maybe into the third quarter. But basically, it's the ultra luxury residences

26:38.000 --> 26:48.640
segment. Three-story houses. Let's see if I have a bit more. No, no, no. I guess the team doesn't

26:48.640 --> 26:56.080
want to steal the show before the product launch. Basically, it's a three-story houses,

26:56.720 --> 27:05.040
but the size is about maybe double or triple of the one at Beyond. We're talking about 1,000

27:05.040 --> 27:12.480
square meters of living space, so you have all the facilities rooms that you might imagine

27:12.960 --> 27:22.880
in your own house. Spa room, living room, of course, but bedroom, bar room,

27:23.920 --> 27:29.600
plenty of parking space, not only for your car, but also for your supercars.

27:32.720 --> 27:39.120
The price range for this would be about 80 to 150 million baht. This would be

27:39.840 --> 27:51.440
the crown jewel of the Nirvana Cowship Prunthepritha. It's the very top end. We put out this

27:54.000 --> 28:03.120
as we believe that the very top end of the spectrum would be less impacted by any uncertainties in

28:03.120 --> 28:15.600
terms of economic development. Our stronghold in terms of target market is in this segment already,

28:17.040 --> 28:26.880
if you can relate Nirvana beyond. This is even higher. It's the ultra luxury segment as opposed

28:26.880 --> 28:37.840
to value luxury segment, which I refer to Nirvana absolute. Those are for maybe more

28:37.840 --> 28:41.520
value of money. That's probably the word I was looking for earlier.

28:46.560 --> 28:53.120
I guess we would get to see the real thing in the next one or two months.

28:53.760 --> 29:02.800
I think in the last part of June, there will be launched for this the most Ratana event.

29:03.920 --> 29:14.400
Again, this is, I would say, second high-rise condominium for Nirvana. We are still very much

29:14.400 --> 29:27.360
landed residential developer. We want to stay that way also. To have a better mix of revenues

29:27.360 --> 29:36.160
and margins and customer base, we think that we should have some flavors of high-rise condominium

29:36.160 --> 29:48.480
as well as a mix. But our condominium is not like other developers. Not necessarily

29:48.480 --> 29:59.440
has to be next to the SkyTrain. We identify area that there's enough communities in that area.

30:00.240 --> 30:10.640
The first, the most, condominium was in Isarapath area. That one was chosen because of Sivagrad

30:10.640 --> 30:23.600
Hospital. We think that the medical personnel, including the students in that area, as well as

30:24.240 --> 30:34.560
the families of those who are hospitalized in the Sivagrad Hospital, would need some sort of

30:35.680 --> 30:42.880
dwelling space close enough to the hospital. That's why we acquired that land. We put out

30:43.920 --> 30:49.520
a low-rise condominium and we practically sold out already for that condominium.

30:50.320 --> 30:58.880
This one in Ratanathipet is a bit different. Not in the medical personnel, but more or less

30:58.880 --> 31:08.560
of the existing communities surrounding the Ministry of Commerce in that area. It's quite

31:08.560 --> 31:16.720
populated. It's quite dense. But there's not much, I wouldn't say no, but there's not much

31:17.600 --> 31:27.520
high-rise residential available in that area. We decided to utilize this land, which has been on

31:27.520 --> 31:37.840
our balance sheet for, I think, already about five or six years during the M&A acquisition with

31:37.840 --> 31:49.680
Daith Group. We're developing into what we call a dual-space condominium. You would have the sense

31:49.680 --> 32:02.160
of two stories living in maybe about 80 to 90 square meters living space. There'll be a loft

32:02.160 --> 32:09.920
that you can put up your bed up front, I mean on top. You can have a living space on the bottom

32:09.920 --> 32:23.200
floor. With the double-space high ceiling, you get that wide area, which is more or less more

32:23.200 --> 32:31.760
breathing room for you during your relaxation days in your own space. This would be about

32:31.760 --> 32:40.480
five billion baht in terms of project value. It will be launched, I think, in the last week of June.

32:45.920 --> 32:52.240
I guess the team has tried to come up with 100 functions, 100 lifetimes. So basically,

32:52.240 --> 32:58.960
what they mean is that there would be plenty of activities in the facilities that you can

33:00.160 --> 33:11.280
use. You name it, all those sports, all those running, all those lane, all those swimming

33:11.280 --> 33:20.080
pool, fitness, and maybe badminton court, or maybe even barbecue space on the high floor

33:20.800 --> 33:27.680
that you can go up and bring your friends and go barbecue on the top floor.

33:28.880 --> 33:35.600
Those are the kind of facilities that we will put up to the customers. You can see that,

33:36.640 --> 33:44.320
I guess, you can take 5.3 billion baht divided by the total of about 1.8 billion baht.

33:44.320 --> 33:51.920
You can see that the entry level to Punnawana product has been brought down through this

33:51.920 --> 34:03.600
condominium. I guess since the inception, Punnawana was built based on a very specific target,

34:05.040 --> 34:11.600
which is basically the segment that we call in real estate is the high-end segment.

34:12.400 --> 34:19.680
So I think we feel that we left out some customers who might want to enjoy

34:20.880 --> 34:28.480
Punnawana product, Punnawana DNA. They cannot afford, let's say, Punnawana Beyond or even

34:28.480 --> 34:38.320
Punnawana Define, which is about 8 million baht townhouse. But this one is about 2 or 3 million

34:38.320 --> 34:48.400
baht condominium unit, double space, Punnawana DNA. The whole enchilada is put into this about

34:48.400 --> 34:56.880
80 to 90 square meters. It's an opportunity for those who might appreciate Punnawana products to

34:56.880 --> 35:10.080
be able to enter into our Punnawana world. As for the administrative issues, I guess,

35:10.080 --> 35:21.760
dividends is all done. We paid last month already, the year was about 3%. We have to retain some cash

35:21.840 --> 35:33.200
to roll out the new project, as we mentioned. So the dividend is about 3%, which I think hopefully

35:33.200 --> 35:44.080
is more acceptable for the shareholder base that we have. More importantly, probably, is the name

35:44.080 --> 35:57.600
change. Nirvana Dayi was our name when Nirvana entered into the stock exchange, I would say.

36:00.000 --> 36:08.640
Originally, we were called Nirvana Development already, prior to listing. It's a pure development

36:08.640 --> 36:23.680
company. But M&A in 2017, when it was finalized, early 2017, we do an M&A with a listed company,

36:24.480 --> 36:37.680
Dayi Group. So after the M&A, we changed Dayi Group into Nirvana Dayi. But now, the change back

36:37.680 --> 36:45.040
to the Nirvana Development name is basically, we want to send the signal back to the market that

36:45.040 --> 36:53.760
we want to refocus in development. If you follow Nirvana closely, you would see that

36:54.720 --> 37:02.080
asset base is very, very much in qualities, high potential. But

37:02.080 --> 37:11.680
the pandemic slowed us down for almost three years. We were not able to utilize those asset base.

37:13.440 --> 37:19.840
In conjunction with this name change, in conjunction with the business direction that we

37:19.840 --> 37:28.160
want to launch nine new projects in one year, highest in our history is basically the same

37:28.160 --> 37:37.120
message that we want to send to the investment communities that we want to come back and focus

37:37.120 --> 37:45.120
on development. The capacities that we have coming through Dayi Group would be used to support

37:46.480 --> 37:55.840
ourselves in terms of development more than we use the extra capacities to provide service to

37:55.840 --> 38:03.440
the others as we might have been in the past five years. The session has come to an end.

38:03.440 --> 38:09.520
So on behalf of the Stock Exchange of Thailand, I would like to thank you investors and corporate

38:09.520 --> 38:15.200
for joining the conference. We look forward to welcome you all again in the next quarter.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.120
Thank you very much and have a good day.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.560
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

38:45.200 --> 38:52.560
Thank you.
