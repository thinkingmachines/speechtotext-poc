907960	914960	I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.
914960	938960	Next, let me introduce the executive summary about the operational highlights and business
938960	943960	overviews for the first half of the year 2023.
943960	958960	Electronic products worldwide were impacted by the global inventory issue and the global weak economic situation during the first half year of 2023.
958960	970960	Therefore, the sales revenue has slightly reduced by 4.45 percent for the first half year of 2023.
970960	981960	But at the same time, the company has been through some internal cost improvement and organization restructuring,
981960	988960	as well as continuously enhanced our automated production system.
989960	1003960	Therefore, the overall net profit has increased by 77.79 percent as compared to the previous year, 2022.
1003960	1012960	On the other hand, although the global electronics market trend is yet to be fully recovered,
1012960	1020960	the company has few more new product implementation since year 2021.
1020960	1030960	Therefore, the company still has positive views for the overall performance in year 2023.
1030960	1048960	So you can see since 2021, our revenue gradually increased due to a few more new customers and new products coming.
1048960	1060960	About the fund-raising program for the company's business implementation plan.
1060960	1073960	The company has resolved the fund-raising program by the insurance and allocation of new issued ordinary shares to the company's shareholders
1074960	1081960	and shall propose for the shareholders meeting approval plans.
1081960	1097960	The rest amount should be mainly to support the factory's expansion plans in Thailand and consider that currently factory capacity are reaching its maximum capacity.
1097960	1119960	Therefore, the company should have an initial plan to construct another four factory facilities with an approaching three-year investment budget plan of US$178 million in order to support the business in the near future.
1119960	1147960	Subsequently, with the capital injection, the company will also be able to enhance the financial structure of the company by reducing approximately about US$14 million financial costs annually in seeking to reduce the uncertainties and impacts later.
1147960	1163960	This is derived from the current global monetary policy race. Overall, it will improve the probability of the company.
1163960	1172960	About our dividend payment for the first half year of 2023.
1172960	1194960	The company consistent dividend payment for the past years and has resolved to pay out the internet dividend at 0.0041 per share for the first half year of 2023,
1194960	1207960	which is about 36% of the company consolidated net profit for the first half year of 2023.
1207960	1228960	The record date for the shareholders who entitled the right to receive the internet dividend was August 30, 2023 and the dividend payment has paid on September 12, 2023.
1228960	1253960	So you can see our sales revenue at the first half year of 2023 slide reduced 4.45% compared to last year. But our net profit achieved US$646 million.
1253960	1274960	It's much better than last year, the first half year. So at the first half year of 2023, the company paid 0.004 dividend. It's better than last year.
1274960	1280960	That's all for our company overview. Thank you very much. Thank you.
1304960	1313960	There are 4 types of products or programs that we produce.
1313960	1321960	For example, we produce non-stallage printing or communication radio.
1321960	1333960	Since Thailand is the main point of production, we plan to expand the factory in Thailand to accept new orders in the coming years.
1333960	1347960	So we have a project to increase the RO fund to create another 4 factories using about US$178 million to accept orders in the future.
1347960	1361960	After that, the company's investment can help to improve the company's financial structure by reducing the financial investment by about US$14 million or about US$486 million.
1361960	1372960	It can help to reduce uncertainty and impact that may occur from the global pandemic. It can also help to increase the company's financial stability.
1373960	1390960	In the past, the company has always been paying dividends. This year, we have been paying dividends in the form of 0.004 baht per share for the first half of 2016.
1390960	1396960	Now, let's hear about the second financial highlight.
1397960	1405960	Hello. Let's talk about the financial performance.
1405960	1411960	First, I will talk about the profit and loss.
1411960	1423960	This is a chart that we compared the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2022 so that you can see the comparison.
1423960	1431960	In the beginning, the sales may have decreased a little compared to last year.
1431960	1445960	But overall, whether it is the initial profit or the net profit, it has increased by more than last year.
1445960	1453960	I will talk a little bit about the profit and loss from the financial system.
1453960	1458960	Currently, the global economy is a monetary system.
1458960	1465960	The net profit has increased by about 2-3 times in the past year.
1465960	1472960	Therefore, the profit from the financial system has also increased.
1472960	1481960	This is one of the main reasons why we have the desire to offer RO this time.
1483960	1491960	Next, let's look at the sales of the first half of 2023.
1491960	1494960	It is at 2,200 million yen.
1494960	1499960	The growth decreased by 4.45% compared to last year.
1499960	1506960	The main reason is the impact from the global economy.
1506960	1515960	The market demand is still weak during the first half of 2023.
1515960	1523960	As for the cost of sales and management, it is at 68 million yen.
1523960	1530960	The annual growth is down to 18.58%.
1530960	1539960	This is due to the improvement of the internal structure in the past two years.
1539960	1546960	There is also a reduction in the cost of management, which is the admin expense.
1546960	1551960	There is also an improvement in the efficiency of production.
1551960	1562960	For example, we use the autonomous system to improve the production of the factory.
1562960	1567960	Overall, we can reduce the cost by 15.58%.
1568960	1580960	The operating profit is at 49 million yen in the first half of 2023.
1580960	1591960	The annual growth has just increased by 188.19% compared to last year.
1591960	1601960	Overall, we have improved the internal structure and the efficiency of production.
1601960	1609960	Overall, the operating profit has grown significantly since last year.
1609960	1618960	The profit of the first half of 2023 is at 19 million yen.
1618960	1625960	The operating profit has grown from 0.48% to 0.88%.
1625960	1632960	The annual growth has increased by 77.79%.
1632960	1640960	This is due to the improvement of the internal structure in the past two years.
1640960	1644960	There is also an improvement in the efficiency of production.
1644960	1652960	Overall, we have improved the internal structure and the efficiency of production.
1656960	1663960	The operating profit is at 0.0032 million yen.
1663960	1668960	The annual growth has grown by 18.24%.
1668960	1674960	The operating profit is at 1.40%.
1674960	1677960	The annual growth has grown by 72.84%.
1677960	1683960	The operating profit is at 6.80%.
1683960	1686960	The annual growth has grown by 73.47%.
1686960	1689960	Overall, we have improved the internal structure.
1690960	1697960	Next, I would like to talk about the payment method.
1697960	1706960	In the past, the company had a policy to pay a fixed amount of payment.
1706960	1713960	This is a table that can be used as a reference for investors.
1713960	1719960	In the past eight years, we have paid a fixed amount of payment.
1719960	1728960	The rate is around 0.009 to 0.01.
1728960	1733960	In the past eight years, we have paid a fixed amount of payment.
1733960	1738960	This is a table that can be used as a reference for investors.
1738960	1743960	In the past eight years, we have paid a fixed amount of payment.
1743960	1748960	The rate is around 0.009 to 0.01.
1748960	1753960	The rate is around 0.01 to 0.01.
1754960	1762960	Next, I would like to talk about the product group.
1762960	1768960	In total, the sales volume from telecom is 19%.
1768960	1775960	The sales volume from computer products is 81%.
1775960	1782960	There are many types of products in the computer product group.
1795960	1801960	Now, please, we would like to invite our Vice Chairman to talk about the business outlook.
1802960	1804960	Thank you.
1804960	1812960	According to the World Bank Global Economic Prospect from July 2023,
1812960	1822960	it was showing that there are a deterioration of science and also losing expertise in the service and self-manufacturing activities.
1822960	1828960	The survey also declined manufacturing activity in some growing numbers of economics,
1828960	1833960	reflecting very high financial costs.
1833960	1841960	Also, excess inventory will become some problems in some sectors.
1841960	1850960	Also, according to the same report, the global financial condition has shown a firm risk sentiment.
1850960	1855960	So, while a growing number of emerging markets and developing economics,
1855960	1861960	central banks have recently paused the monetary titan or lowered the policy rate,
1861960	1871960	but the monetary policy has tightened further in most of the advanced economies in the second quarter of 2023.
1871960	1887960	We will continue to enhance and upgrade our automation and our industrial 4.0 factory system to be more competitive
1887960	1895960	and also to be more competitive to the other competitors.
1895960	1903960	And also, despite the global economic uncertainty, which I just mentioned in the previous page,
1903960	1908960	and also the flood consumption spending in the first half of 2023,
1908960	1916960	the company, our team has been very aggressive and very successfully implement new products,
1916960	1923960	such as small wearable device, pause machine, which support the company's growth momentum,
1923960	1935960	even given the world market demand as being sluggish for the entire 2023.
1935960	1944960	The company will also continue to pursue for new potential market and also new product,
1944960	1952960	such as EV charging station, IoT home security business, and lower earth orbit satellite product.
1952960	1965960	And these are the future trend for the product that we think it has a very promising future for the following years.
1982960	1987960	From the point of view of the higher monetary policy and the problem of lack of materials,
1987960	1991960	even though our foreign economy is still uncertain,
1991960	1999960	our company is still confident that we have the potential to compete with competitors.
1999960	2006960	We have been able to develop and improve our factory to the highest level of our capabilities,
2006960	2013960	whether it is autonomous or 4.0 industrial factory.
2013960	2022960	We also have new products coming in, whether it is wearable device, pause machine,
2022960	2029960	EV charging station, IoT home security business, lower earth orbit satellite product,
2029960	2035960	and other products that will come in the following years.
2035960	2041960	This is a section of the answer to the question from the investor.
2041960	2047960	So we would like to go to the next slide.
2048960	2053960	So we would like to go to the Q&A sections.
2053960	2061960	So please allow me to read some questions in Thai and then explain to the management in English.
2061960	2066960	Okay, let's start with the questions.
2066960	2080960	The first question is about the account receivable of Kimpo.
2080960	2104960	So an investor, they would like to ask that the account receivable from Kimpo is very high.
2104960	2113960	So why do you give so much credit for them and then not letting the Kimpo to pay faster?
2113960	2117960	Okay, well, thank you very much for the question.
2117960	2125960	We are trying to get as much business as possible as I mentioned in the previous page.
2125960	2132960	Our team, even given the worldwide economic situation is not doing well,
2132960	2139960	we are still gaining a lot of new product from our affiliate companies as well.
2139960	2153960	So I'm not legally allowed to comment on individual customer situation,
2153960	2166960	but we are certainly doing all we can and also try to shorten the account receivable length and date as much as possible.
2166960	2170960	But that all depends on how we negotiate with our customer.
2170960	2182960	And as you can see right now, even the first half of 2023, our revenue went down a little bit,
2182960	2189960	but then we are trying to cut down our SG&A costs and try to cut down other expense.
2189960	2201960	These are the efforts that I think our entire team members continue to do in order to become more competitive and more efficient companies.
2201960	2214960	So we will certainly continue to pursue and also ask our customer to be able to maintain or to improve their payment terms.
2214960	2218960	But at this point of time, these are the payment terms that we have been talking about.
2218960	2227960	We've been decided and their payment terms are also being not just to us, it's also from their customers as well.
2227960	2232960	So these are just the business decisions that we do need to make.
2233960	2242960	For a moment, Mr. President explained that the company, as we just presented,
2242960	2247960	we have a new company that will come in and produce.
2247960	2255960	Currently, we cannot comment on any customer.
2255960	2265960	But if we talk about the overall picture, I would say that the payment terms are for all of our customers and vendors.
2265960	2269960	It's a negotiation term.
2269960	2282960	The company will use the autonomous system to control other things or to reduce the expenses of the admins.
2282960	2285960	So overall, the company is still in good shape.
2286960	2290960	Talking about the payment terms, it's a general payment.
2290960	2296960	It's not a market term.
2296960	2311960	The next question is about the price of the market.
2311960	2338960	So the investor would like to ask that since the market price currently in Thailand is quite low,
2338960	2350960	will the company consider to cancel this capital increase because we may get only a little money from the capital increase,
2350960	2355960	but it will have a big impact to the share dilutions?
2355960	2359960	Yes, once again, thank you for the question.
2359960	2369960	We understand that currently the stock market pricing is not our most favorable pricing right now.
2369960	2375960	But as you can see from the video that Kun Tso showed to you,
2375960	2389960	there is a mass expansion that is required for Calcom Thailand to do in order to get more business and also to get new possible business opportunities.
2389960	2403960	So as a management team, we cannot really comment on what's the right price for our stock pricing.
2403960	2420960	What we can do is we try our best to perform, like I said, we try to cut our expense, try to cut our costs and try to improve our performance
2420960	2432960	and then in terms that we can have a better share dividend output or the payout in the future.
2432960	2445960	So right now we do need to have this new share release in order to gain the funding for building our new factory.
2445960	2449960	And that's a very critical mission for us right now.
2449960	2462960	So we would like to still continue to perform on this new share issuing and we hope all the shareholders can support us on this.
2479960	2492960	The next video that I am going to present to you is about the company's plan to expand its factory in Thailand.
