58
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

59
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

60
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

61
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

62
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

63
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

64
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

65
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

66
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

67
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:14,960
I'm going to show you a little bit of what it looks like when you put it in the water.

68
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Next, let me introduce the executive summary about the operational highlights and business

69
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,960
overviews for the first half of the year 2023.

70
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Electronic products worldwide were impacted by the global inventory issue and the global weak economic situation during the first half year of 2023.

71
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Therefore, the sales revenue has slightly reduced by 4.45 percent for the first half year of 2023.

72
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:21,960
But at the same time, the company has been through some internal cost improvement and organization restructuring,

73
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:28,960
as well as continuously enhanced our automated production system.

74
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Therefore, the overall net profit has increased by 77.79 percent as compared to the previous year, 2022.

75
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:52,960
On the other hand, although the global electronics market trend is yet to be fully recovered,

76
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,960
the company has few more new product implementation since year 2021.

77
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Therefore, the company still has positive views for the overall performance in year 2023.

78
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:28,960
So you can see since 2021, our revenue gradually increased due to a few more new customers and new products coming.

79
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:40,960
About the fund-raising program for the company's business implementation plan.

80
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:53,960
The company has resolved the fund-raising program by the insurance and allocation of new issued ordinary shares to the company's shareholders

81
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,960
and shall propose for the shareholders meeting approval plans.

82
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:17,960
The rest amount should be mainly to support the factory's expansion plans in Thailand and consider that currently factory capacity are reaching its maximum capacity.

83
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Therefore, the company should have an initial plan to construct another four factory facilities with an approaching three-year investment budget plan of US$178 million in order to support the business in the near future.

84
00:18:39,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Subsequently, with the capital injection, the company will also be able to enhance the financial structure of the company by reducing approximately about US$14 million financial costs annually in seeking to reduce the uncertainties and impacts later.

85
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:23,960
This is derived from the current global monetary policy race. Overall, it will improve the probability of the company.

86
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:32,960
About our dividend payment for the first half year of 2023.

87
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:54,960
The company consistent dividend payment for the past years and has resolved to pay out the internet dividend at 0.0041 per share for the first half year of 2023,

88
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:07,960
which is about 36% of the company consolidated net profit for the first half year of 2023.

89
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:28,960
The record date for the shareholders who entitled the right to receive the internet dividend was August 30, 2023 and the dividend payment has paid on September 12, 2023.

90
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:53,960
So you can see our sales revenue at the first half year of 2023 slide reduced 4.45% compared to last year. But our net profit achieved US$646 million.

91
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:14,960
It's much better than last year, the first half year. So at the first half year of 2023, the company paid 0.004 dividend. It's better than last year.

92
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,960
That's all for our company overview. Thank you very much. Thank you.

93
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:53,960
There are 4 types of products or programs that we produce.

94
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:01,960
For example, we produce non-stallage printing or communication radio.

95
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Since Thailand is the main point of production, we plan to expand the factory in Thailand to accept new orders in the coming years.

96
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:27,960
So we have a project to increase the RO fund to create another 4 factories using about US$178 million to accept orders in the future.

97
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:41,960
After that, the company's investment can help to improve the company's financial structure by reducing the financial investment by about US$14 million or about US$486 million.

98
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:52,960
It can help to reduce uncertainty and impact that may occur from the global pandemic. It can also help to increase the company's financial stability.

99
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:10,960
In the past, the company has always been paying dividends. This year, we have been paying dividends in the form of 0.004 baht per share for the first half of 2016.

100
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Now, let's hear about the second financial highlight.

101
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Hello. Let's talk about the financial performance.

102
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,960
First, I will talk about the profit and loss.

103
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:43,960
This is a chart that we compared the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2022 so that you can see the comparison.

104
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:51,960
In the beginning, the sales may have decreased a little compared to last year.

105
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:05,960
But overall, whether it is the initial profit or the net profit, it has increased by more than last year.

106
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:13,960
I will talk a little bit about the profit and loss from the financial system.

107
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Currently, the global economy is a monetary system.

108
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,960
The net profit has increased by about 2-3 times in the past year.

109
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Therefore, the profit from the financial system has also increased.

110
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:41,960
This is one of the main reasons why we have the desire to offer RO this time.

111
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Next, let's look at the sales of the first half of 2023.

112
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,960
It is at 2,200 million yen.

113
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,960
The growth decreased by 4.45% compared to last year.

114
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,960
The main reason is the impact from the global economy.

115
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:15,960
The market demand is still weak during the first half of 2023.

116
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:23,960
As for the cost of sales and management, it is at 68 million yen.

117
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,960
The annual growth is down to 18.58%.

118
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:39,960
This is due to the improvement of the internal structure in the past two years.

119
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,960
There is also a reduction in the cost of management, which is the admin expense.

120
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,960
There is also an improvement in the efficiency of production.

121
00:25:51,960 --> 00:26:02,960
For example, we use the autonomous system to improve the production of the factory.

122
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Overall, we can reduce the cost by 15.58%.

123
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:20,960
The operating profit is at 49 million yen in the first half of 2023.

124
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:31,960
The annual growth has just increased by 188.19% compared to last year.

125
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Overall, we have improved the internal structure and the efficiency of production.

126
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,960
Overall, the operating profit has grown significantly since last year.

127
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:58,960
The profit of the first half of 2023 is at 19 million yen.

128
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,960
The operating profit has grown from 0.48% to 0.88%.

129
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,960
The annual growth has increased by 77.79%.

130
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,960
This is due to the improvement of the internal structure in the past two years.

131
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,960
There is also an improvement in the efficiency of production.

132
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Overall, we have improved the internal structure and the efficiency of production.

133
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,960
The operating profit is at 0.0032 million yen.

134
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,960
The annual growth has grown by 18.24%.

135
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,960
The operating profit is at 1.40%.

136
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
The annual growth has grown by 72.84%.

137
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,960
The operating profit is at 6.80%.

138
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,960
The annual growth has grown by 73.47%.

139
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Overall, we have improved the internal structure.

140
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Next, I would like to talk about the payment method.

141
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:26,960
In the past, the company had a policy to pay a fixed amount of payment.

142
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,960
This is a table that can be used as a reference for investors.

143
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,960
In the past eight years, we have paid a fixed amount of payment.

144
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:48,960
The rate is around 0.009 to 0.01.

145
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,960
In the past eight years, we have paid a fixed amount of payment.

146
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,960
This is a table that can be used as a reference for investors.

147
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,960
In the past eight years, we have paid a fixed amount of payment.

148
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,960
The rate is around 0.009 to 0.01.

149
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,960
The rate is around 0.01 to 0.01.

150
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Next, I would like to talk about the product group.

151
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,960
In total, the sales volume from telecom is 19%.

152
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,960
The sales volume from computer products is 81%.

153
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,960
There are many types of products in the computer product group.

154
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Now, please, we would like to invite our Vice Chairman to talk about the business outlook.

155
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Thank you.

156
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,960
According to the World Bank Global Economic Prospect from July 2023,

157
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:22,960
it was showing that there are a deterioration of science and also losing expertise in the service and self-manufacturing activities.

158
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,960
The survey also declined manufacturing activity in some growing numbers of economics,

159
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,960
reflecting very high financial costs.

160
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Also, excess inventory will become some problems in some sectors.

161
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Also, according to the same report, the global financial condition has shown a firm risk sentiment.

162
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,960
So, while a growing number of emerging markets and developing economics,

163
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,960
central banks have recently paused the monetary titan or lowered the policy rate,

164
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:11,960
but the monetary policy has tightened further in most of the advanced economies in the second quarter of 2023.

165
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:27,960
We will continue to enhance and upgrade our automation and our industrial 4.0 factory system to be more competitive

166
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,960
and also to be more competitive to the other competitors.

167
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:43,960
And also, despite the global economic uncertainty, which I just mentioned in the previous page,

168
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,960
and also the flood consumption spending in the first half of 2023,

169
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:56,960
the company, our team has been very aggressive and very successfully implement new products,

170
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,960
such as small wearable device, pause machine, which support the company's growth momentum,

171
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:15,960
even given the world market demand as being sluggish for the entire 2023.

172
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:24,960
The company will also continue to pursue for new potential market and also new product,

173
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:32,960
such as EV charging station, IoT home security business, and lower earth orbit satellite product.

174
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:45,960
And these are the future trend for the product that we think it has a very promising future for the following years.

175
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,960
From the point of view of the higher monetary policy and the problem of lack of materials,

176
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,960
even though our foreign economy is still uncertain,

177
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,960
our company is still confident that we have the potential to compete with competitors.

178
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,960
We have been able to develop and improve our factory to the highest level of our capabilities,

179
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,960
whether it is autonomous or 4.0 industrial factory.

180
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:42,960
We also have new products coming in, whether it is wearable device, pause machine,

181
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,960
EV charging station, IoT home security business, lower earth orbit satellite product,

182
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,960
and other products that will come in the following years.

183
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,960
This is a section of the answer to the question from the investor.

184
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,960
So we would like to go to the next slide.

185
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,960
So we would like to go to the Q&A sections.

186
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:21,960
So please allow me to read some questions in Thai and then explain to the management in English.

187
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Okay, let's start with the questions.

188
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:40,960
The first question is about the account receivable of Kimpo.

189
00:34:40,960 --> 00:35:04,960
So an investor, they would like to ask that the account receivable from Kimpo is very high.

190
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:13,960
So why do you give so much credit for them and then not letting the Kimpo to pay faster?

191
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Okay, well, thank you very much for the question.

192
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:25,960
We are trying to get as much business as possible as I mentioned in the previous page.

193
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Our team, even given the worldwide economic situation is not doing well,

194
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,960
we are still gaining a lot of new product from our affiliate companies as well.

195
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:53,960
So I'm not legally allowed to comment on individual customer situation,

196
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:06,960
but we are certainly doing all we can and also try to shorten the account receivable length and date as much as possible.

197
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,960
But that all depends on how we negotiate with our customer.

198
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:22,960
And as you can see right now, even the first half of 2023, our revenue went down a little bit,

199
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,960
but then we are trying to cut down our SG&A costs and try to cut down other expense.

200
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:41,960
These are the efforts that I think our entire team members continue to do in order to become more competitive and more efficient companies.

201
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:54,960
So we will certainly continue to pursue and also ask our customer to be able to maintain or to improve their payment terms.

202
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,960
But at this point of time, these are the payment terms that we have been talking about.

203
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:07,960
We've been decided and their payment terms are also being not just to us, it's also from their customers as well.

204
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,960
So these are just the business decisions that we do need to make.

205
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:22,960
For a moment, Mr. President explained that the company, as we just presented,

206
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,960
we have a new company that will come in and produce.

207
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Currently, we cannot comment on any customer.

208
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:45,960
But if we talk about the overall picture, I would say that the payment terms are for all of our customers and vendors.

209
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,960
It's a negotiation term.

210
00:37:49,960 --> 00:38:02,960
The company will use the autonomous system to control other things or to reduce the expenses of the admins.

211
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,960
So overall, the company is still in good shape.

212
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Talking about the payment terms, it's a general payment.

213
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,960
It's not a market term.

214
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:31,960
The next question is about the price of the market.

215
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:58,960
So the investor would like to ask that since the market price currently in Thailand is quite low,

216
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:10,960
will the company consider to cancel this capital increase because we may get only a little money from the capital increase,

217
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,960
but it will have a big impact to the share dilutions?

218
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Yes, once again, thank you for the question.

219
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:29,960
We understand that currently the stock market pricing is not our most favorable pricing right now.

220
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,960
But as you can see from the video that Kun Tso showed to you,

221
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:49,960
there is a mass expansion that is required for Calcom Thailand to do in order to get more business and also to get new possible business opportunities.

222
00:39:49,960 --> 00:40:03,960
So as a management team, we cannot really comment on what's the right price for our stock pricing.

223
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:20,960
What we can do is we try our best to perform, like I said, we try to cut our expense, try to cut our costs and try to improve our performance

224
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:32,960
and then in terms that we can have a better share dividend output or the payout in the future.

225
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:45,960
So right now we do need to have this new share release in order to gain the funding for building our new factory.

226
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,960
And that's a very critical mission for us right now.

227
00:40:49,960 --> 00:41:02,960
So we would like to still continue to perform on this new share issuing and we hope all the shareholders can support us on this.

228
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:32,960
The next video that I am going to present to you is about the company's plan to expand its factory in Thailand.

229
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:50,960
So right now it is something that we need to do, we need to invest, we need to invest and we need to give the rights of our shareholders as a priority in order to protect the benefits of our shareholders.

230
00:41:50,960 --> 00:42:00,960
So as a CEO, I would like to give you an additional explanation of what we are investing in in order to build and expand our factory.

231
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:14,960
So after this, we will be able to attract new customers, whether they are new products or new customers that will come into Thailand, into our company.

232
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:27,960
We will be able to generate more profit and we will be able to make a good profit for all stakeholders.

233
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:38,960
So right now, we would like the shareholders to see the company as one.

234
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,960
We will continue to do our best. Thank you.

235
00:42:43,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Next, we have a question about the gross profit margin of the new factory. What would be the gross profit margin for the new factory as compared to the old factory?

236
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Maybe Kunzo, you can help us to explain this, to share some of the information to our shareholders.

237
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Okay, as I mentioned to everybody, we have an OEM manufacturing service company.

238
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:50,960
So whatever new factory or old factory, we will continue to implement our automation production system to reduce our cost.

239
00:43:50,960 --> 00:44:10,960
So no matter new factory or old factory, we will try our best to improve our gross profit.

240
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:40,960
As Kunzo mentioned, we have an OEM manufacturing service company. So whatever new factory or old factory, we will continue to implement our automation production system to reduce our cost.

241
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:57,960
What we are doing right now, you can see from the presentation, we can reduce the cost of the company.

242
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:04,960
So this is the target that we want to continue to implement.

243
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:26,960
Sorry, we don't have time right now. If you have any questions, you can contact us via IR.

244
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Thank you very much.

245
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,960
Thank you very much.
