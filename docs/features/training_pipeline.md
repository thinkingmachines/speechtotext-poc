# Milestone: GPU-Optimized Training Pipeline

## Description
Develop a training pipeline optimized for GPU acceleration to efficiently fine-tune the Whisper model.

## How it works
1. Implement data parallel training for multi-GPU setups.
2. Optimize batch sizes and learning rates for GPU training.
3. Implement mixed-precision training to reduce memory usage and increase speed.
4. Set up checkpointing for resumable training and model versioning.

## Gotchas / Specific Behaviors
- Monitor GPU memory usage to prevent out-of-memory errors.
- Ensure reproducibility of results across different GPU configurations.
- Implement proper error handling for GPU-related issues.
