# Milestone: Tensorboard Integration

## Description
Integrate Tensorboard for real-time monitoring and visualization of the training process and model performance.

## How it works
1. Set up Tensorboard logging in the training script.
2. Define relevant metrics to be tracked (e.g., loss, accuracy, learning rate).
3. Implement custom visualizations for Thai-specific metrics if needed.
4. Provide instructions for accessing and interpreting Tensorboard dashboards.

## Gotchas / Specific Behaviors
- Ensure Tensorboard logs don't consume excessive storage over time.
- Implement proper authentication for accessing Tensorboard in shared environments.
