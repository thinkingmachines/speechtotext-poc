# Milestone: Custom Dataset Integration

## Description
Develop a pipeline to integrate and preprocess custom Thai audio datasets for model training and evaluation.

## How it works
1. Design a standardized format for audio files and transcriptions.
2. Implement data cleaning and normalization processes.
3. Create a data loader that efficiently feeds the custom dataset into the training pipeline.
4. Implement data augmentation techniques specific to audio data (e.g., noise injection, speed perturbation).

## Gotchas / Specific Behaviors
- Ensure consistent audio quality and transcription accuracy across the dataset.
- Handle various audio formats and convert them to a standard format.
- Implement proper handling of Thai character encodings in transcriptions.
