# Milestone: Thai Speech-to-Text Fine-Tuning

## Description
Fine-tune the open-source Whisper model specifically for Thai language speech-to-text conversion, improving accuracy and performance for Thai audio inputs.

## How it works
1. Collect and preprocess a diverse dataset of Thai audio recordings and their transcriptions.
2. Utilize Hugging Face's Whisper implementation as the base model.
3. Implement a fine-tuning pipeline using custom Thai dataset.
4. Train the model on GPU infrastructure for efficient processing.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics specific to Thai language.

## Gotchas / Specific Behaviors
- Attention to Thai-specific phonetics and tonal system is crucial for accurate transcription.
- Handling of code-switching between Thai and English in spoken language.
- Consideration of different Thai dialects and accents.
