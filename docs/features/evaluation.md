# Milestone: Model Evaluation and Benchmarking

## Description
Develop a comprehensive evaluation pipeline to assess the performance of the fine-tuned model on Thai speech-to-text tasks.

## How it works
1. Implement standard speech recognition metrics (e.g., Word Error Rate, Character Error Rate).
2. Develop Thai-specific evaluation metrics if necessary.
3. Create a test dataset representative of various Thai speech patterns and accents.
4. Implement a benchmarking system to compare performance against baseline models.

## Gotchas / Specific Behaviors
- Ensure the evaluation dataset is separate from the training dataset to prevent data leakage.
- Consider regional variations in Thai pronunciation when evaluating performance.
- Implement proper handling of Thai-specific linguistic features in error rate calculations.
